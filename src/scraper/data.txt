Learning Analytics for TDT4100 | Læringsanalyse er systematisk innsamling og analyse av data om læringsaktiviteter og sammenhengen med læringsutbytte. Målet er å få mer innsikt i hva som skaper god læring og bruke det til å forbedre våre emner. Våren 2017 ble det samlet inn data om hvordan studentene jobber med programmering i TDT4100, vha. et eget panel i Eclipse (se https://www.ntnu.no/wiki/display/tdt4100/Exercise-panelet). Panelet samler inn data om koding, kjøring, testing og feilfinning, og denne oppgaven handler om å analysere og utnytte disse dataene på ulike måter: analyse av arbeidsvaner med feedback til studenter om forbedringsmuligheter. oversikt over fremdrift på øving og emnenivå for studenter (hvordan gjør jeg det ift. medstudenter), stud.asser (hvordan går det med mine studenter) og faglærer (hvordan går det med klassen). analyse av kodingspraksis og programmeringsproblemer ved analyse av kode-snapshots. annet man kan få ut av dataene analyse av arbeidsvaner med feedback til studenter om forbedringsmuligheter oversikt over fremdrift på øving og emnenivå for studenter (hvordan gjør jeg det ift. medstudenter), stud.asser (hvordan går det med mine studenter) og faglærer (hvordan går det med klassen) analyse av kodingspraksis og programmeringsproblemer ved analyse av kode-snapshots annet man kan få ut av dataene  | Hallvard Trætteberg | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=1610
Mining dynamic graphs | For many important applications, data is presented as graphs, with dynamic relationships between nodes. Examples include graphs representing the power grid, financial transaction relationships, social networks, and transportation networks. The nodes in the graphs can also have attached dynamic data, for example time series, adding further challenges. The aim of this project is to 1) study previous work related to this topic, 2) identify interesting and useful data mining operations to be performed on dynamic graphs, 3) develop algorithms/indexes for efficient execution of one or more of these operations, and 4) evaluate these on a large dataset.  | Kjetil Nørvåg | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2949
Next best offer/identifying “twins” based on transaction data | This project is in cooperation with, and with co-supervisor from, Sparebank 1 SMN. Expanding on the methodology in papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm , we would like to implement a similar system on our own data. Extending the model could possibly be done by using the pseudo social network to generate features to be used as inputs in some AI/ML system in combination with other data or some other form of hybrid model. papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm A very large data set of transactions needed to construct the graph will be provided. In addition, some data on product ownership and/or product purchases will be provided that can be used to create the prediction model specified in the paper. Depending on the quality of the models created, available time and the interests of the groups, setting up a live test of the model with a control group might also be possible in order to test the real life performance of the predictions.  | Kjetil Nørvåg | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2946

A plausible way to understand simple correlations in Norwegian texts | Sticos are developing a bot called @else (http://else.sticos.no) to help Human Resources (HR) departments be more efficient in their work. A lot of their time is consumed by reoccurring questions from their employees and managers. For years HR software have tried to tackle this problem by using a personnel manual. However, the use of it is sparse. The problem lies in accessibility and the fact that is easier to ask the question directly and get a qualified answer to your problem on the fly. Sticos develops and sells personnel manuals. All rules and answers to employees questions lies in the texts from the personnel manuals. Our customers can also write their own specific rules in the system. An example correlation is: "An employee can have up to 10 days paid leave in order to take care of his sick kids under the age of 12. However, if the employee has more than 2 children under the age of twelve, he gets 5 days extra. A total of 15 days." The correlations here are: . •	one kid under 12 years : 10 days paid leave . •	two kids under 12 years: 10 days paid leave. •	three or more kids under 12 years: 15 days paid leave    The project can focus on one or more of the following aspects: 1. Grammatical analytics and statistical classification have different strength and weaknesses. Where IBM and Googles language understanding originates from those different approaches. Today Google, IBM and others uses a hybrid combination of both to understand text better. What is a proper combination of these techniques to understand a Norwegian text? 2. In order to reduce work and secure consistency we want @else to use the personnel manuals when answering questions from employees. What is the best way to achieve this?  | Rune Sætre | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2294

Active learning for industrial entity matching with machine learning | Cognite are bringing modern cloud software and data analysis to many industrial companies. A common obstacle for industrial companies is that they have data residing in many different systems without common identificators (equipment, time series, 3D models, documents, etc). To gain value from digitalization it's important to be able to work across several data sources - e.g. click on something in a 3D and see its sensor time series. Entity matching is the problem of deciding which records from two different data sources refer to the same real-world entity. In this project the student(s) will explore how active learning can be used to get better training data for machine learning models. Active learning is the setting where the computer can choose which examples to label next. If we ask the user for the most informative examples we can potentially get by with fewer examples. The work will be done on large real-world datasets from Cognite and potentially other open datasets.

AI automated cardiovascular therapy and diagnostics | For cardiovascular therapy as well as valve repair or replacement, a hybrid operating room is becoming a prerequisite. To facilitate a correct device deployment the relationship between the anatomy and the position of the instruments has to be known and presented to the surgeon. The position of the instruments and the geometry of the vascular tree is best visualized on Xray images, with a wide field of view, however the resulting images are 2D projections of the 3D world for a given a position of the X-ray source. On the other hand the heart’s anatomy is very well depicted using ultrasound images (e.g. 3D transesophageal ultrasound - TEE), however these images have a much smaller field of view due to the positioning of the TEE probe with regards to the heart. Therefore, tools that can automatically identify the position and orientation of the ultrasound probe and cathethers in X-ray images as well as automatic localization of anatomic structures of interest is highly desirable. Today most of these tasks are solved manually or semi-automatically, however automating them would improve the accuracy and also reduce the amount of time the interventionalists spend on aligning the images. We propose three topics for master theses all related to interventional applications of ultrasound imaging. They are:. - AI for ultrasound probe detection in X-ray images, the task will be to identify the location of the ultrasound probe but also its pose  - AI for catheter detection in the ultrasound volume and highlight of it in the image. The goal is to automatically detect catheter, delivery device and artificial devices (like MitraClip or artificial valves). Those objects give somewhat different echo signals but not always very clear nor complete. The task will be to detect automatically such objects within 3D ultrasound datasets. - AI for aortic valve detection in mitral trans esophageal acquisitions of the heart. Previous work supervised by Gabriel Kiss have been focusing on automatically detecting the mitral valve in 3D ultrasound data. This project aims at also detecting the aortic valve. The ultimate goal is automatic detection of anatomical structures running very fast (real-time if possible), so that the 3D data could automatic be presented in a way that makes sense to the physician, by rotating, cropping the 3D data based on the information detected in the images.

App for tidlig deteksjon av dysleksi | Forskning ved psykologisk institutt indikerer at en underliggende årsak for blant annet dysleksi og dyskalkuli kan være dysfunksjon i visuell prosessering. Nærmere bestemt er det nerveceller som flytter informasjon saktere hos disse gruppene enn hos de som ikke har disse utfordringene. Disse nervecellene kalles magnoceller og har i hovedsak ansvar for å oppfatte raske forandringer i omgivelsene.

Augmented reality tools for cardiac and bronchoscopic procedures | The aim of this work is to develop a new visualization framework using mixed reality which may improve the way data is presented to an operator during a cardiac ultrasound exam or bronchoscopy procedure. One of the main challenges for an operator during the procedure is to process the data coming from various image sources displayed on several screens scattered around the room and combine this with apriori knowledge in the form of segmented natomic models. By gathering information from important image sources using an existing open source research platform and presenting the data in an intelligent manner and then visualizing it in the operator's field of view, we hope to improve the the ergonomic condition of the operator and increase the success rate of various procedure.

Big data and AI methods for CP Diagnosis |   Brain injury in newborns accounts for more than 9 million years lived with disability worldwide. The functional consequences of early brain injury in newborns are commonly seen months or even years after birth, delaying therapeutic interventions and leaving families with uncertainty about their child’s health status for months and years. Classification of movement characteristics and movement patterns in spontaneous movements in young infants has in recent years been presented as the most accurate method for early identification of infants who will later develop serious motor problems and reduced motor function (like cerebral palsy). Today, characteristic of such normal and abnormal infant spontaneous movement could be objectively captured and processed by computer software from video recordings but the procedures are so far too imprecise, cumbersome and time consuming for clinical use (see here for more information).  here  Based on a database of 1400 video recordings at St. Olav’s University Hospital of infants at risk of neurological dysfunctions from multiple sites worldwide, in particular Norway, USA and India, this student assignment aims at solving the following tasks: 1) To identify infant body segments (legs, arms, trunk and head) from the database of video recordings using computer vision and AI algorithms. 2) Make this procedure time effective, feasible and available for researchers within the medical field without any technical or computer vision expertise.

Blockchain-based Data Marketplace | The European regulations about privacy, the GDPR, is changing people’s understanding and attitude towards data/information they own and those the others own. The ownership of data/information has always been a concern but with GDPR there will be more awareness as well as more obligations related to data collection and sharing. Today data-monopolies like Facebook, Google, Amazon (FGA)  etc. are relying most of their business on the data they collect about people, and this without paying for this data. In the near future, people will conceive  information/data as “commodity”, i.e., something that can be sold and bought. For example, with the enforcement of GDPR all people will be able to get the data that companies such as FGA collect about them and then sell it to smaller companies that may use this data for generating new business models. The topic of this thesis is to develop further the blockchain-based data marketplace that enables data selling and buying while resolving trust and privacy problems. The Data Marketplace uses Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts to allow peers to communicate about the conditions of data sharing and perform the data exchange itself. For example, this platform will make me able to sell my facebook data to a company and provide service to me for  bargaining about the price as well as  including my privacy preferences and constraints into the deal. The peer-to-peer interaction for monetary and privacy related will be done by agents where agents “machine learn” the preferences of their owners (i.e.,  the peers). 1 - 2 students. We can demonstrate the current platform as well as developing use cases to you as an inspiration. Then we can discuss about the way forward.

Computational Creativity | To be creative, we need to produce something which is new, meaningful and has some sort of value. Computers are able to support humans in creative processes, but to also themselves be creative or to assess if an idea or a product is creative. A master thesis project on computational creativity can investigate any creative field matching the interests and backgrounds of the student or students (language, design, music, art, mathematics, computer programming, etc.), and concentrate on one or several aspects of computational creativity, such as the production, understanding or evaluation of creativity, or on computer systems that support human creativity.  | Björn Gambäck | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2014
Computational Lingustic Creativity | Computational linguistic creativity can be aimed at creating systems that either are creative themselves (e.g., generate poetry, write lyrics to music, produce analogies or metaphors; or chatterbots), or try to understand creativity (e.g., identify sarcasm, understand humour or interpret rhymes), or support humans in creative processes (such as PhotoShop in the image domain), or evaluate creativity. A master thesis project in the field could concentrate on one or several of these different aspects of computational linguistic creativity (e.g., generate and evaluate computational poetry, or translate on-line jokes between two languages). | Björn Gambäck | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2819
Computational Musical Creativity | Computers have been used in music both as support for creativity and as creative agents themselves, and both for the composition of the music scores and for writing lyrics. The first algorithmic composition system appeared already in the 1950s (the Illiac suite, Hiller & Isaacson 1958), and since then rule-based systems, stochastic methods, grammar-based methods, neural networks, and evolutionary methods have all been utilised to compose music, and/or for generating lyrics. A master thesis on the topic could address any of these strands and approaches, depending on the student(s) background and interests.  | Björn Gambäck | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2822
Computer vision for road maintenance -  for municipality | Trondheim Kommune (TK) has one car equipped with a roof mounted 4K camera. The car drives around the city on various assignments and records while driving.
Currently the 4K camera is out of order, however, we have data from multiple trips on the same road segment for a period of 4 months from the beginning of 2020. In order to add value to these recordings, we would like to create a proof of concept using computer vision in order to:. 1) detect potholes. 2) detect cracks in the road. 3) detect roadside signage. With the list above:. 1) Once a pothole is detected, the location of the hole needs to be checked against. responsibility areas. A message should be generated in the form of a work order, so a. team (of the respective road owner/maintainer) can go out and fix the hole.. 2) Cracks that are detected are to be logged with the location and status. Every time the. same crack gets detected, it should be compared to the previous status. If the crack. reaches a size which is no longer acceptable, a work order is to be generated in the same  manner as 1).           The time series of images is to be used as input for machine learning in order to predict when cracks reach a no longer acceptable size/shape. . Basic pothole/crack/signage detection based on OpenCV will be  available on github from a customer driven project and a master thesis this year.  Data:. - (recorded) video stream from moving car. - location (GPS - only partial coverage). - map with TK responsibility areas (some roads are maintained by Trondheim Kommune, others by Statens Vegvesen). - map with road signs      1 or more students.

Conversational Approach to News | Traditional media houses publish news stories that are either updated or replaced with new stories as events are unfolding.  The stories are presented as complete texts that are supposed to be read from beginning to end.  For small devices like mobile phones it may be interesting to look into other ways of presenting news stories.  In some recent experiments news stories have been broken up into several pieces that have either been structured as a conversation or presented piece by piece by avatars. In this project we will investigate how summarization techniques and conversational agents (chatbots) can be used to present news stories in more interactive innovate ways.  Summarization techniques help us extract prominent sentences or generate new summative sentences of the stories.  The project needs to explore how conversational agents, that normally need chat logs or mapping rules to work, can be modified to work with news stories rather than logs as input.  A solid understanding of machine learning and NLP is needed in this project.  | Jon Atle Gulla | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2733

De-identification of text documents for privacy protection | Many public & private organisations struggle to manage the personal data they gather or produce. This data may relate to patients, customers, welfare recipients, or even defendants in court cases. Such data must comply with privacy and data protection laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) newly introduced in Europe. In particular, personal data cannot be distributed to third parties (or used for secondary purposes) without legal ground, such as the consent of the individuals to whom the data refers. In many organisations, a large portion of this data takes the form of text documents. For instance, electronic health records often include a wide variety of clinical notes. The ubiquity of such text data is often problematic from a privacy perspective, as text documents are much harder to anonymise than structured databases. In this thesis, you will develop new machine learning models to automatically de-identify text documents – that is, detect the occurrence of personal identifiers (such as names, addresses or telephone numbers) and mask them from the text. Although de-identification does not always amount to “full anonymisation” (as it may still be possible to identify persons through indirect clues), it is often a necessary first step and considerably reduce the disclosure risk. More specifically, the student will develop and evaluate neural models for sequence labelling that take text documents as input and identify text spans including personal information. One particular challenge that will need to be addressed is how to handle semi-structured formats, such as clinical notes that are often divided in multiple sections. This master thesis will be conducted as part of the CLEANUP (Machine learning for the anonymisation of unstructured personal data) project. The student will be expected to work on Norwegian data provided by one of the CLEANUP project partners and stored on TSD (see www.uio.no/tsd). The exact dataset will be determined at a later stage.

Decentralized AI | Nowadays, big tech giants, such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, IBM and Microsoft, are dominating the AI market by offering cloud-based AI solutions and APIs. They are collecting user data in one place through free services and systems, analyze it for insights and resell to third parties, such as advertisement companies. This model is centralized AI, which is working fine now. But in the long-run it could lead to monopolization of the AI market. This could also cause unfair pricing,  lack of transparency, interoperability, privacy issues and excluding smaller companies from AI innovation. Fortunately, there is the emergence of a decentralized AI market, born at the intersection of blockchain, on-device AI and edge computing/IoT.
In this project, we will investigate the possibility to build a proof-of-concept of a decentralized AI application through blockchain, such as Ethereum. AI agents will train and learn models from their own data. The decentralized AI application to be developed in this project then can combine multiple algorithms/models (developed by different agents) performing different sub-tasks. One of possible applications is Decentralized Autonomous Cars. 1 - 2 students. We can demonstrate the current result from previous master project as an inspiration. Then we can discuss about the way forward.

Deciding what to purchase: How do we consume information on social commerce platforms like Amazon? | An increasing amount of purchases are done through social commerce platforms such as Amazon. These platforms differ from conventional e-shops in that they contain a lot of information that is produced by consumers themselves. This creates an interesting mix, where potential buyers have to navigate through information that is produced by marketers and consumers and based on this make assessment of which products to buy. Research has suggested that the types of products we buy also influences how we process information. This project will focus on examining consumer behaviors on popular social commerce website such as Amazon. It will include the use of eye-tracking techniques with an experienced researcher and involve the design and execution of studies with participants and subsequent interviews with them.  | Patrick Mikalef | Valgbart | En student | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2569
Deep Learning to combat with micro-plastic pollution | An estimated 275 million tonnes of plastic waste was produced on a global scale in 2010, with 8 million of those tonnes being introduced to the oceans - about 3% of global annual plastics waste. Once the plastic reaches the oceans, it is broken down into smaller particles(micro-plastic) by being exposed to ultra violet (UV) radiation and mechanical abrasion from wave actions [1].The quantity of plastic waste floating at the ocean surface in 2013 was estimated to be approximately 269,000 tonnes (small macro- to micro-plastic), this estimate does not include plastic in-depth or at the seafloor). The plastic debris can affect the wildlife in multiple ways, such as entanglement- entrapping, encircling, or constricting,ingestion- accidental ingestion or ingestion of prey containing plastic, and interaction- being in contact with plastic debris [1].It is therefore important to be able to detect and collect the plastic waste in nature,before it reaches the oceans. Once plastic waste has reaches a micro-stadium, it is near impossible to collect it and remove it from the water. An analysis on deep sea locations(range from 1176 to 4843m) showed that there was an average abundance of 1 micro-plastic per 25cm3(particle sizes ranging from 75 to 161μm) [2] The AI-task will support the observation and monitoring of plastic items​ at consumer side, such as cities, beaches..... We will monitor the geographic distribution of different types of plastic items in these areas. The data will be gathered by citizens in form of taking photos of plastic objects. The photos will be taken using an application on smart phones. The application will have an artificial intelligence (deep learning) algorithm specially tailored for recognition of the material type of the plastic in the photos. The combined information about the geographic distribution, plastic type, and the object type (e.g., bottle, bag) pertinent to plastic debris will be collected in a database which in turn will be statistically analyzed and visualized. The smart application will serve as a tool for empowering citizen science and will contribute to the increase of the awareness and collaboration of citizens towards mitigation of plastic pollution problem.

Discovering unknown pollutants: Bridging machine learning with data on chemistry&biology | This project aims towards the development of an artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) to identify unknown pollutants in environmental samples. In the environment there are  many natural and man made organic contaminants originating from industrial and domestic sources. Most of these contaminats are either not known at all yet or their detection is problematic. Beside this, some of them may transform into another substance which might be more toxic than the orginal forms. In the complex environmenta matrix, it is very dificult to detecet those contaminats and their derivatives because of the huge amount of data.  AI/ML, e.g., a combination of supervised ML and data analysis methods, can offer an innovative way for effective detection of those emerging contaminats and evaluation of their sources, transformation and removal mechanisms. This project is a collaboration between IDI and the Department of Chemistry at NTNU. The annotated/training data will be obtained from existing open chem/bio databases plus from the Chem. Department while the latter will also provide the to-be-recognized data. There will be domain experts in chem. dept. who will be part of the team. PS! Students not in the AI line can apply if they have taken "Methods in AI",  and machine learning or AI programming.

Discovery and scoping of data for industrial entity matching | Cognite is bringing modern cloud software and data analysis to many industrial companies. A common obstacle for industrial companies is that they have data residing in many different systems without common identificators (equipment, time series, 3D models, documents, etc). To gain value from digitalization it's important to be able to work across several data sources - e.g. click on something in a 3D and see its sensor time series. Entity matching is the problem of deciding which records from two different data sources refer to the same real-world entity. In this project the student(s) will explore how users can discover and scope records which are to be matched from two different data sources using state-of-the-art techniques from information retrieval/data mining/machine learning. For users faced with the challenge of matching records the first hurdle is understanding and getting an overview of data, and then subsequently selecting the subset of the data that is of interest. It is key that the user is given appropriate tools to overcome this crucial task in the entity matching workflow. The work will be done on large real-world datasets from Cognite and potentially other open datasets.   | Jon Atle Gulla | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2882

Entity-level sentiment impact analysis in social media texts | A key aspect of sentiment analysis is identifying the target(s) of the opinion, that is, to determine which entities in a text the expressed sentiment relates to. Exploring how textual entities are related to a text’s overall sentiment can yield information on how given entities are portrayed in social media, e.g., on Twitter. This requires the application of sentiment analysis techniques as well as named entity recognition and linking, and the use of heuristic or grammatical features to determine entity relevance and sentiment strength.  | Björn Gambäck | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2821
Explainable Recommender Systems | In news recommendation both collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation techniques are used.  Often contextual features like time and location, as well as additional data from social media, are also taken into account to personalize news services to each individual reader.  Due to the complexity and number of recommendation strategies employed, it is difficult for the reader to understand the logic behind the recommended articles. The lack of transparency hampers readers’ trust in the system and makes it hard to detect flaws in the recommendation engine. In this project the students will develop a standard news recommender system for an existing news dataset from the local newspaper Adresseavisen (3 months of Norwegian news articles). A number of different recommendation techniques must be implemented, and the students need to work out and implement strategies for explaining and justifying the ranking of news articles.  Whereas this can be done with reference to prominent words or phrases in content-based recommendation, the machine learning-based techniques in collaborative filtering may be more difficult to explain.  Good knowledge of recommender systems, text analytics and machine learning are useful.  | Jon Atle Gulla | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2730
Explaining Fake News | Fake news stories are stories that deliberately try to disinform readers or spread hoaxes via traditional media channels.  Their intent is to mislead in order to damage parties, people or organizations, or for financial gains.  Recent work on network analysis, linguistic properties and classification has tried to use machine learning and other techniques to detect fake news stories by contrasting them with verified true stories.  Unfortunately, even if a fake story is identified, the techniques have not been very good at explaining why the story is considered fake. In this project we will investigate the use of word embeddings for explaining fake news stories.  The assumption is that we have already detected a fake news story.  We will first build and fine-tune word embeddings for the Norwegian news domain.  When these embeddings are available, we will explore various semantic strategies for exposing the fake parts of the story in ways understandable to readers.  The project assumes a solid understanding of natural language processing and AI.  | Jon Atle Gulla | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2731
Exploring the black box of AI Governance | AI governance is a notion that is often attributed to a range of different practices and processes. From establishing a process of developing AI applications, ensuring that quality outcomes are achieved, and to decising the role and responsibilities of stakeholders. AI governance now plays an important part related to the business value that AI can deliver, and to ensuring that projects comply with ethical and regulatory frameworks. This project will seek to understand how organizations develop AI governance practices, what aspects they take intio accoutn when doing so, how they deploy them, and what the outcomes of them are at the business and project performance levels.  | Patrick Mikalef | Valgbart | En student | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2909
Fake news detection | The impact of news articles on society can not be underestimated and as the number of online news is increasing, distinguishing fake news from real news is becoming a challenge for readers. This project focuses on analyzing and tracking news articles from different news sources or social media channels in order to detect fake or misleading news. Various machine learning techniques will be used in addition to computational linguistics and link analysis.  There are English datasets available for fake news detection, though it may be necessary also to collect your own dataset. The details of the project can be clarified with a discussion with the students.   Supervisor:  Özlem Özgöbek  | Jon Atle Gulla | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2441
Gender bias in texts and text analysis | Gender and other demographic biases in machine learned models have received increased attention in recent years. Language models and language analysis have been shown to be highly affected by such biases, which has triggered research on fair representations of gender in language models, aiming both at building and using fairer training and evaluation datasets, and at changing the actual learning algorithms themselves. There is still a lot of room for improvements though, both in those methods and in ways to quantify bias as such.  | Björn Gambäck | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2937
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and  opportunities it brings: analysis of my all-data and generating insights | After enforcement of GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)  (May 2018), all companies and institutions collecting data about individuals are obliged to deliver to people the data they collected about them (e.g., whatever facebook, google, amazon, insurance companies etc collects about me shall deliver the data they collected about me when I asked for it). GDPR will give a chance for people to look into her/his data stored by those companies.
So, what people can do with so much (and rich) data about themselves? It would be super hard for them to analyze, extract insights and even look into the raw data downloaded from Facebook, Google, etc.. This project aims to process and analyse in various ways the data people have about themselves to extract/discover new information about their own habits, preferences, intentions, faults, things they should be more careful about, etc. - which even themselves may not be aware of. This kind of insight may be valuable for the individual themselves, but also for others (e.g, insurance, entertainment companies, banks). The data collection, analysis and visualisation are present in a developing app. Data analysis and machine learning is focus. 1-2 students. We can demonstrate the current result and the developing app from previous master project as an inspiration. Then we can discuss about the way forward.  | Hai Thanh Nguyen | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2600

Human-AI interaction and decision-making | As a increasing amount of organizational decision-making is based on insght generated by sophisticated algorithms, there is a need to understand how key stakeholders interact with interfaces that aid such decisions. From insight to action requires that generated insight is presented and designed in such a way so that it can be readily "consumed" byt decision-makers, and that it satisfies informational requirements without overloading the recipient. Such design must incorporate several aspects, such as ifnroamtion presentation, detail, interface design, interactivity and others. If AI-generated insight is to reach its potential, it is important that we understand how to develop such interfaces with human decision-makers under different contextual and time-related requirements  | Patrick Mikalef | Valgbart | En student | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2925
Hvordan maksimere Quality av Life av brukere - basert på Trondheim Kommune data | Studenten skal utvikl en data model og et system for å hjelpe  å maksimere Quality of Life ved å bruke data fra Trondheim kommune. 
Dataene kan være enten estimerte eller målte, de vil ha ulik grad av nøyaktighet, og kan komme fra ulike typer datasett. 
Noen datasett vil være lette å finne, mens noen vil komme med som følge av linked data.
Quality of Life vil være målt for en eller flere bestemte kontekster som vi selv definerer. 
I første omgang gjelder det å finne gode kontekster og sammenhenger som har betydning for Quality of Life i disse kontekstene. 
Senere vil det også kunne være aktuelt å lage et lite program som bruker dette i en mer praktisk setting.  | Pinar Öztürk | Tildelt | En student | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2884

Industrial entity matching on documents with machine learning | Cognite are bringing modern cloud software and data analysis to many industrial companies. A common obstacle for industrial companies is that they have data residing in many different systems without common identificators (assets, time series, 3D models, documents, etc). To gain value from digitalization it's important to be able to work across several data sources - e.g. click on something in a 3D and see its sensor time series. Entity matching is the problem of deciding which records from two different data sources refer to the same real-world entity. In this project the student(s) will explore how one can utilize NLP techniques in entity matching when one of the data sources are documents. While typical records only contain short (usually structured) strings, we are sometimes interested in matching with larger documents, for example matching documents describing pieces of equipment. Current entity matching methods does not support this in a good way, and so we need to explore how existing techniques from NLP and/or information retrieval can be integrated. The work will be done on large real-world datasets from Cognite and potentially other open datasets.

Industry friendly modeling for labeled property graphs | Cognite is delivering digital twin and industrial IOT software to industrial companies across manufacturing, oil&gas and power&utilities. The core of Cognite's offering is called Cognite Data Fusion(CDF) and is powered by a labeled property graph concept that enables flexible modeling of industrial information systems for small and larger companies to collaborate in projects and in operations. It is unclear what modeling methodology and modeling language that are most suited to enable both small and big companies to utilize the power of CDF. There is also a need to generate a domain model based on the information model for users and systems to be able to store and navigate the information, and the methodology should take into account how the domain model may change during the course of the project and during the lifetime of the industrial asset. The master project involves evaluating and recommending industrial friendly modeling methodologies, modeling languages and domain model lifecycles and is carried out in close collaboration with Cognite and their customers.  The students should expect to spend some time with Cognite in Oslo to understand the technology and the methodological requirements.  | Jon Atle Gulla | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2791
Informasjonsgjenfinning i semantiske data | Semantisk web data brukes på flere og flere områder og kjennetegnes av å være en lavnivå representasjon av data med eksplisitt semantisk typing. Data lagres typisk i triple-stores og aksesseres med spørringer i sparql. Dette gjør at informasjonen er vanskelig tilgjengelig uten dedikerte applikasjonsspesifikk programvare. I denne oppgaven skal studenten(e) undersøke og prøve ut hvordan informasjonsgjenfinning og interaktive teknikker kan brukes for å søke og hente ut informasjon fra databaser med semantisk web data. Brukeren skal kunne søke med termer og setninger, or resultatet som returneres skal være forståelig og lesbart. Oppgaven kan tilnærmes på forskjellige måter og ha et mer spesifikti fokus som: Indeksering, søk, rangering av semantiske data. Learning to rank teknikker. Entitets-orientert søk.

Machine Learning to improve the Air Quality in Trondheim | Over the last year we have created a dataset with information on air quality data and we started to explore machine learning methods for predicting the air quality for the next 12/24/48 hours as well as visualize the results. In this thesis we would like to continue this work and investigate time series methods as well as reinforcement learning methods targeting the effect of decisions taken to improve the air quality. This work will be part of a collaboration with Telenor Research under the ongoing AI4EU research project (https://www.ai4eu.eu/). https://www.ai4eu.eu/  | Kerstin Bach | Tildelt | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2658
Managing big data volumes | Oppgaven går ut på å studere metoder for parallell innsetting av store mengder data. Oppgaven er formulert generelt, men kan ha spesifikk fokus på data fra visse anvendelser, f.eks. geografiske data fra satelitter. Det er også stor interesse for å kunne effektiv ha parallell innsetting i tradisjonelle trær som B-trær og R-trær. Det er også stor interesse for å kunne sette inn sekvensielle data som i en logg. F.eks. Lagring av GPS-spor i databaser (trajectories). Mange muligheter her.  | Svein Erik Bratsberg | Valgbart | En student | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2054
Manuell oppfølging av sau på beite |   Sau slippes på vårparten ut på beite. Hele sommeren går sauene fritt rundt i terrenget. I denne perioden krever myndighetene at det drives jevnlig oppsyn med sauene. Bonden må da ut og gå i terrenget hvor sauene befinner seg for å sjekke at alt står bra til. I tilfelle han detekterer at noen sau er syke eller døde må han iverksette tiltak for ivaretakelse av sauenes velferd. Sau slippes på vårparten ut på beite.

Merging of geodata | Merging of data from space-filling curves used in e.g. R-trees. 
In the era of velocity of big data, geodata needs to be merged
just like key-based data is merged in LSM-trees to cater for high
insertion rates. Investigate methods for doing this. Merging in LSM trees is also a hot research topic.  | Svein Erik Bratsberg | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2504
Merging of offline databases | The problem is to find solutions to merging of databases which have been offline for a while. This may for instance be rescue teams working in areas with no connection, and which needs to synchronize its work.  | Svein Erik Bratsberg | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2719
Mining Feature-sets for Detection of Bias and Discrimination in Data - For Fair AI. | This project is about discovering  feature sets in data that creates discrimination in decision-making  AI systems. Discrimination is a problem that the Field of Fairness in AI needs to deal with. It has been shown that existing AI system that rely on models trained with arbitrary  dataset may discriminate certain groups of people when they are used for decision making in the process of hiring people, approving bank loan, etc. The decisions are often unadventagous for a group with a (set of) shared attributes, e.g., skin colour, gender, age, etc. In this project, the student(s) will develop a method for discovering/mining the set of features from a data set that may create discrimination if the data set is used for decision making. Note that this is very dependent on the characteristic of the data set, how representative it is for different groups and how balanced it is w.r.t various featue values. The student(s) should have taken Methods in AI course, and it is an adventage to have taken Machine learning course as well. Take a look at this paper :Detecting Group Differences: Mining Contrast Sets( Stephen D. Bay & Michael J. Pazzani) archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income Take also look at this in general for the ethical AI problems: www.finn.ai/article/ethics-of-ai-in-banking/ www.finn.ai/article/ethics-of-ai-in-banking/  | Pinar Öztürk | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2856

Narrative-driven recommendations | Many online services provide users with recommendations, to help them find items of interest in the enormous space of available choices. Popular examples of such recommender services include videos (YouTube), music (Spotify), movies (Netflix), online shopping (Amazon), etc. These services typically base their recommendations on items liked/disliked by users. In this project we address a narrative-driven recommendation scenario (detailed in this paper), where the user specifies her preferences in a short textual summary, complemented with a small set of positive and negative examples. The objective is to develop novel recommendation methods that can effectively utilize this information. this paper   | Krisztian Balog | Tildelt | En student | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2667
Native Language Identification | Native Language Identification is the task of identifying the native language of a writer based solely on a sample of their writing in another language. The task is typically framed as a classification problem where the set of native languages is known beforehand. Most work has focused on identifying the native language of writers learning English as a second language. The master thesis work connects to previous work in IDI's AI group and potentially involves participation in a "shared task competition" on Native Language Identification where training and test data is made available by the organisers (such as https://sites.google.com/site/nlisharedtask2013/).  | Björn Gambäck | Valgbart | En student | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=1554

The direction of specialization is to be discussed with the candidate and potential external user interests.  | John Krogstie | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=26
Remote Learning and Collaboration with Augmented Reality and Hololens 2 | Augmented Reality (AR) can provide rich and interactive learning experiences and performance augmentation for remote distributed learners. The use of AR for collaboration and learning has significantly increased during the ongoing pandemic and has been widely adopted by several companies (e.g. Equinor), hospitals treating COVID-19 patients (https://www.businessinsider.com/london-doctors-microsoft-hololens-headsets-covid-19-patients-ppe-2020-5?r=US&IR=T) and educational institutions. The goal of this master project is to perform research on the design principles and tools for AR-supported collaborative learning while working with several Hololens 2 units (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/). Depending on the interests of the student(s), the project will be connected to a company (e.g. Equinor), St. Olavs hospital or a course taught at NTNU. The project is done in collaboration with IMTEL lab (https://www.ntnu.edu/ipl/imtel).

Scientific literature recommendation | Many online services provide users with recommendations, to help them find items of interest in the enormous space of available choices. Popular examples of such recommender services include videos (YouTube), music (Spotify), movies (Netflix), online shopping (Amazon), etc. In this project, we wish to provide recommendations for scientific literature to researchers. ArXivDigest is a platform for personalized scientific literature recommendation. It allows users to sign up and receive a digest email with recommended research articles that are published on arXiv.org. The recommendation part of the platform is open, meaning that external systems can generate and submit recommendations for users, and there is a broker infrastructure in place that combines these. ArXivDigest arXiv.org  This project concerns the development of the arXivDigest platform along one or more of the following aspects: Extracting data from personal homepages/DBLP/Google Scholar pages with the aim to improve recommendations. Specifically, it would be very useful to get a list of publications from the author and what other people they work with.. Adding search functionality to the site. (With a perspective on adding personalization and explanation of search results later.). Developing a set of recommendation approaches that consider the people and organizations that a person typically cites or follows. (E.g., "We recommend this article to you because you cite X Y in your recent work".). Working on the service itself by developing the web interface for systems with improved analytics. This would be coupled by research on novel evaluation measures. Extracting data from personal homepages/DBLP/Google Scholar pages with the aim to improve recommendations.

Sentiment Analysis in Tweets | In recent years, micro-blogging has become prevalent, and the Twitter API allows users to collect a corpus from their micro-blogosphere. The posts, named tweets, are limited to 140 characters, and are often used to express positive or negative emotions to a person or product. In this project, the goal is to use the Twitter corpus to do sentiment analysis, that is, to classify tweets as to whether they express positive or negative opinions, or are neutral/objective. The work could build on previous master theses at NTNU, and potentially aim to participate in a shared task competition on Twitter Sentiment Analysis.  | Björn Gambäck | Valgbart | En student | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2041
Sentiment Analysis of Figurative Language in Twitter | The master thesis project is aimed at the automatic classification of tweets containing figurative language, that is, language which intentionally conveys secondary or extended meanings (such as sarcasm, irony and metaphor). Such figurative language creates a significant challenge for sentiment analysis systems, as direct approaches based on words and their lexical semantics often are inadequate in the face of indirect meanings. One goal of the project is to find a set of tweets that are rich in figurative language,  another goal is to determine whether the writer of each such tweet has expressed a positive or negative sentiment, and possibly the degree to which this sentiment has been communicated. For the data collection part, the project could tentatively build on data sets from the Semantic Evaluation (SemEval) shared task exercises, in particular the tweets annotated for figurative language in SemEval-15 (Task 11) and those annotated for sarcasm in the SemEval tasks on Twitter sentiment analysis (Sem-14 Task 9, SemEval-15 Task 10, SemEval-16 Task 4).

Sporing av sau ved hjelp av enkel radioteknologi | Masteroppgave: 
Sporing av sau ved hjelp av enkel radioteknologi Bakgrunn. Bøndene slipper sauene ut på fritt beite rundt midten av mai og sanker de inn igjen fra september og til snøen legger seg. I denne tiden går sauen fritt i skog og fjell med tilsyn i prinsippet en gang i uka. Sanking av sauene om høsten er en flertrinnsoperasjon som normalt tar et antall uker. Man går oftest gjennom et par runder per hovedbeiteområde hvor de aller fleste sauene lokaliseres og drives hjem til gården. Dernest følger en fase hvor de siste skal lokaliseres og bringes hjem. Denne siste fasen er oftest langvarig og arbeidskrevende da man ofte ikke har noen god formening om hvor sauene befinner seg. Systemet vi skal utvikle har primært til hensikt å effektivisere lokaliseringen av disse siste sauene slik at sauebonden kan spare det meste av det svært tidkrevende søkearbeidet.   Målbildet for operativt system. Vi ønsker å utstyre hver enkelt sau og lam med en meget liten batteridrevet radio. Radioen skal være så liten at den kan inkluderes i sauens øremerke uten at dette økes i areal. Radioen skal ha en rekkevidde på opptil 300 til 500 meter. Radioen skal sende ut et «ping» med jevne mellomrom som kan fanges opp av en drone. . Man benytter en flydrone til å søke etter sauene over et stort areal. Når flydronen mottar et signal fra en eller flere sauer, registrerer den sin egen GPS-posisjon. Vi vet da et sauen befinner seg innenfor en radius av 300 til 500 meter i forhold til dronens posisjon. Det vil også være mulig å måle avstanden til sauen ved å gå over i såkalt «ranging-modus» så snart en har mottatt signal fra sauen. Denne informasjonen lastes ned til en sentral hvor en bonde på et kart vil se dronens rute og hvor den har registrert sau.    Radioteknologi. Radiodelen av systemet skal baseres på Long Range Bluetooth chip nRF52833 fra Nordic Semiconductor. Ved hjelp av utviklingskit skal en lage en demonstrator for systemet. Hvis tiden tillater det, kan en gjøre feltforsøk som demonstrerer rekkevidden til systemet.   Samarbeidspartnere.

Talking robots | Conversational agents (chatbots) are systems that can enter into dialogues with real users.  Most current chatbots are rule-based, but some newer systems are based on generative models and machine learning.  We are working on a generative conversational system for DNB's customer requests.  The system makes use of deep learning, with a dataset of chat logs from DNB.  As part of this work, we are looking into how conversational agents may be incorporated into robots with fascilities for speech generation and speech recognition.  An example of such a robot is the robot heads manufactured by Furhat Robotics in Sweden. In this project the students will explore ways of incorporating conversational agents into robots.  In particular, we need to investigate how the limited functionality of a conversational agent may be extended to serve as a full-fledged conversational partner with access to external knowledge and dialogue state information.  The project requires a solid understanding of machine learning and interests in NLP.   | Jon Atle Gulla | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2845

Using Artificial Intelligence to Predict Student Performance using Eye-tracking Data and Facial Expressions | The focus of the thesis is to develop artificial intelligence pipelines to enhance the prediction of student performance in individual learning tasks, such as video-based learning, programming, assessment. The challenge is to create pipelines that are better suited for a small number of students but with high frequency data (eye-tracking and facial expressions). Thesis Description. In a first step, the student(s) will design and implement the pipeline with existing datasets. Afterwards, they will conduct a small user study in order to test the effectiveness of the pipeline in two different scenarios (the number of scenarios can be decided later). Finally, the candidate(s) will analyse the collected data and write up his/her thesis.  Requirements. The ideal candidate will have a background in basic machine learning and artificial intelligence. Solid programming skills and an interest in hands-on development and experimentation is also a requirement.. Programming skills: Python.

Using Evolutionary Algorithms to Investigate Language Evolution | The aim of this project will be to use evolutionary algorithms as a vehicle to investigate the main dynamics in language evolution. Language evolution is a highly multi-disciplinary research field with the main theories involving biological evolution, language learning, and cultural evolution. When trying to understand the origins of languages, we can try to compensate for the lack of empirical evidence by utilising evolutionary computational methods to create simulations of how language may have evolved over time, e.g., by creating "language games" to simulate communication between agents in a social setting. In general, simulations on language evolution tend to have relatively small and fixed population sizes, something this study could aim to change.  | Björn Gambäck | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2939
Using multi-objective optimization to meet fairness and justice requirements from AI | Ethical issues in Artificial intelligence and machine learning has become a hot topic in the last couple of years. It is a very complicated and broad issue. This project focuses only on one dimension of it: fairness. It is known that human beings make discrimination in employee hiring situation and evaluation of bank loan applications on the basis of gender, ethnic origin, race, etc. Computer systems using machine learning (ML) methods are found to repeat the same kind of discrimination. There are various fairness approaches and theor mathematical formulations in form of metrics. However it is not possible to meet 2 or more of these metrics in the same AI system. The student will starts with a survey on the state-of the art work on machine discrimination using the existing data sets (e.g. IBM-360), and may develop a new metric for measuring fairness of ML methods or use/develop a method for implementing an optimal trade-off between 2 or more existing fairness criteria.One example aling these lines is the use of genetic algorithms for multi-objective optimization with objectives high accurcy and good fairness. PS! Students not in the AI line can apply if they have taken "Methods in AI",  and machine learning or AI programming or Bio-inspirerte metoder faget (IT 3708).  | Pinar Öztürk | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2764

Utvikling av metoder for effektiv detektering av støtende ytringer | I denne oppgaven skal du/dere implementere og evaluere tekstbaserte systemer for analyse av hatefulle ytringer i sosiale media. Hovedfokus for denne oppgaven vil være å viderføre arbeidet som er gjort så langt og utvikle nye metoder som støtter flere språk enn bare Engelsk og Norsk. Se her for mer informasjon om tidlig arbeid.  | Heri Ramampiaro | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2787
Value of AI Technologies | AI and Big Data technologies are central in many digitalization or digital transformation projects.  They are sometimes used to cut costs of existing services, but the technology is often adopted to offer improved or brand new services.  There are today best practices from many industry sectors, and practitioners are researchers have worked out guidelines for the integration of AI in organizations.  However, many projects suffer from a lack of understanding how the nature of AI affects technical infrastructures and business strategies, and social and ethical implications are often underestimated  and not sufficiently addressed. In this project the students will investigate in more detail how AI creates value along the value chain.  We will identify critical features of AI-based solutions and analyze how these features affect organizations’ business strategies, create opportunities or impose limitations.  Central to the project is a solid understanding of the complexities of AI and what it takes for an organization to benefit from the technology.  The intention is to work out detailed technical and organizational guidelines and checklists for leveraging AI-based solutions to create long-term business value. In-depth discussions with companies may be needed as part of this analysis.  | Jon Atle Gulla | Valgbart | Gruppe / En eller flere studenter | https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2732

Wearable Memory Augmentation: Moving Cued Recall out of the Lab | Supervisors: Evangelos Niforatos and Michail Giannakos Thesis Description Thesis Description Thesis Description From the outset, the student will review the related literature in the field of human memory theory to familiarize themselves with the fundamentals of human memory augmentation and the state of the art. Next, the student will develop 3 mobile and wearable application prototypes (in Android) that are able to deliver memory cues, and receive feedback by employing the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) on (a) a typical mobile phone, (b) a smartwatch , and (c) a pair of smart glasses. The student will also develop the required back-end (eg, in PHP / MySQL or Node.js) for collecting and storing the ESM data, and any additional metrics. The student will test the effectiveness of the 3 application prototypes in real life settings by recruiting a sufficient number of participants (> 20) in a longitudinal study (ie, field deployments).
