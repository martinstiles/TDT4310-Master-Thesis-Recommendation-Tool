Most of the 3D FER state-of-the-art methods extract hand-crafted features [1-5], which could be considered as a digital signature of the face, and use them in order to compare different 3D faces through trained classifiers or similarity functions [6]. . The rise of deep learning networks tends to replace the hand-crafted features with features automatically extracted by the deep networks. Nonetheless, deep networks require large training datasets in order to converge and produce reliable results.. Up until recently, deep networks could not be sufficiently implemented in the case of 3D FER for two reasons: 1) lack of existence of large labelled 3D face datasets for training and 2) deep networks could not consume 3D data (3D meshes, point clouds etc.) as input.. The 1st issue has been solved with the improvement of the 3D data acquisition hardware. More and more 3D face datasets are produced [7-9], along with software capable of producing synthetic 3D face models [10], which can further augment the real data within a deep training process.. For resolving the 2nd issue, initially, the methodologies converted the actual 3D data into a 2D modality like depth images or geometry images [11, 12]. Thus making the data compatible with the existing deep networks. This is expected to change in the near future, due to the newest machine learning trend, the so-called Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) [13,14]. GDL introduces deep networks that can be fed with 3D meshes, point clouds and graphs. Thus, GDL models are very interesting to be studied in order to find out whether they can achieve a performance boost in terms of 3D FER evaluation measures, as they have already done in other computer vision applications.. Additionally, and depending on the progress, more applications of the system will be examined i.e. 3D Facial Expressions Recognition or 3D Facial Micro-expressions Detection.      ======================.

However, the advances in hardware speed and capabilities due to the advancement of Moore's Law that enabled this so-called \"software bloat\" are coming to an end. Accordingly, a movement advocating for lean software has surfaced [1]. This is based on the observations that earlier computers were able to provide a useful working environment including a graphical user interface and networking with far fewer resources. One system demonstrating the possibility of creating such a lean system is Niklaus Wirth's Project Oberon system [2]. Using a self-designed programming language, Oberon, and his own RISC processor implemented on a tiny FPGA, Wirth was able to create a system including a graphical user interface, networking, and a compiler running on a 25 MHz CPU in 1 MB of RAM. The complete system is open source, including the hardware and compiler, the source code for hard- and software can be read by a single person on a rainy weekend. Your task will be to support the analysis if a reduced resource system can also be efficiently implemented using a RISC V CPU core [4]. RISC V is an open source specification that has enabled a large number of implementations ranging from small embedded cores to high-performance 64-bit multicores. The first step enable this is to adapt the Oberon compiler backend to generate RISC V code instead of code for Wirth's RISC machine. In addition, you will extend an open source Project Oberon simulator system [5] to support a RISC V CPU, which will enable you to test your compiler output. Optionally, a hardware implementation on an FPGA based on an open source RISC V core is possible. Useful prerequisites for working on this project are experience with assembler programming and computer architecture, and basics of compilers and code generation. Experience with C/C++ programming (for extending the simulator) or hardware design (for creating the FPGA system) is useful. [1] N.

A common obstacle for industrial companies is that they have data residing in many different systems without common identificators (equipment, time series, 3D models, documents, etc). To gain value from digitalization it's important to be able to work across several data sources - e.g. click on something in a 3D and see its sensor time series. Entity matching is the problem of deciding which records from two different data sources refer to the same real-world entity. In this project the student(s) will explore how active learning can be used to get better training data for machine learning models. Active learning is the setting where the computer can choose which examples to label next. If we ask the user for the most informative examples we can potentially get by with fewer examples.

Currently, DNV GL Group Technology and Research is actively developing a conceptual autonomous ship called ReVolt. ReVolt is dedicated as a platform for exploring and experimenting how to integrate novel technologies and equipment into autonomous ships to achieve the required level of ocean autonomy. \nThe most crucial and novel part of ReVolt is the navigation system which integrates both matured and novel maritime technologies, various types of sensors and machine learning technologies to achieve different levels of ship navigation. It has been widely recognized that cyber-physical systems highly depending on various types of sensors and complex algorithms to operate are both vulnerable to physical harm and subjected to cyberattacks. Therefore, we need to fully assess the potential cyber risks to assure that ReVolt can safely operate and complete its missions. Based on the current implementation of Revolt, we have identified several tasks to be carried to help DNV GL understand the feasibility of potential cyberattacks against the navigation system of ReVolt. Consequently, such learning and experience will help DNV GL define new class rules for certifying autonomous ships and develop Verification & Validation (V&V) requirements for autonomous ships. As deep neural networks (DNNs)-based computer vision technologies have been widely used in autonomous cars to detect their surroundings, it is very promising to use similar technologies in the navigation system of autonomous ships. However, it has been proven that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the form of subtle perturbations to inputs. Such subtle perturbations in the images are often too small to be perceptible by human vision, yet they may lead the DNNs to output wrong results. . In this task, the candidate will firstly explore existing adversarial input attacks against DNN-based object recognition models. Secondly, the candidate will experiment how to successfully attack the obstacle detection implemented on ReVolt either in a lab environment (e.g., simulation environment) or field environment.

The focus of the thesis is to use artificial intelligence (AI) and multimodal data (MMD) to understand and support children\u2019s learning experiences through a carefully designed dashboard and data driven feedback mechanisms. MMD is derived from eyetracker, wrist band, and motion sensor (i.e., skeletal tracking). The dashboard provides the educational facilitator (i.e., instructor or parent) with a real-time visualisation of the learners cognitive, affective and physiological state based on the collected MMD. AI components will produce feedback mechanisms, which may be delivered directly to the learner, or to their educational facilitator.  Thesis Description. In a first step, the student needs to review the literature and familiarize themself with multimodal dashboard system. Then, the candidate will conceptualise and implement AI components to drive feedback mechanisms which support the learner during learning activities (directly or via their educational facilitator).

To facilitate a correct device deployment the relationship between the anatomy and the position of the instruments has to be known and presented to the surgeon. The position of the instruments and the geometry of the vascular tree is best visualized on Xray images, with a wide field of view, however the resulting images are 2D projections of the 3D world for a given a position of the X-ray source. On the other hand the heart\u2019s anatomy is very well depicted using ultrasound images (e.g. 3D transesophageal ultrasound - TEE), however these images have a much smaller field of view due to the positioning of the TEE probe with regards to the heart. Therefore, tools that can automatically identify the position and orientation of the ultrasound probe and cathethers in X-ray images as well as automatic localization of anatomic structures of interest is highly desirable. Today most of these tasks are solved manually or semi-automatically, however automating them would improve the accuracy and also reduce the amount of time the interventionalists spend on aligning the images. We propose three topics for master theses all related to interventional applications of ultrasound imaging. They are:. - AI for ultrasound probe detection in X-ray images, the task will be to identify the location of the ultrasound probe but also its pose  - AI for catheter detection in the ultrasound volume and highlight of it in the image. The goal is to automatically detect catheter, delivery device and artificial devices (like MitraClip or artificial valves). Those objects give somewhat different echo signals but not always very clear nor complete. The task will be to detect automatically such objects within 3D ultrasound datasets. - AI for aortic valve detection in mitral trans esophageal acquisitions of the heart. Previous work supervised by Gabriel Kiss have been focusing on automatically detecting the mitral valve in 3D ultrasound data. This project aims at also detecting the aortic valve. The ultimate goal is automatic detection of anatomical structures running very fast (real-time if possible), so that the 3D data could automatic be presented in a way that makes sense to the physician, by rotating, cropping the 3D data based on the information detected in the images.

The ownership of data/information has always been a concern but with GDPR there will be more awareness as well as more obligations related to data collection and sharing. Today data-monopolies like Facebook, Google, Amazon (FGA)  etc. are relying most of their business on the data they collect about people, and this without paying for this data. In the near future, people will conceive  information/data as \u201ccommodity\u201d, i.e., something that can be sold and bought. For example, with the enforcement of GDPR all people will be able to get the data that companies such as FGA collect about them and then sell it to smaller companies that may use this data for generating new business models. The topic of this thesis is to develop further the blockchain-based data marketplace that enables data selling and buying while resolving trust and privacy problems. The Data Marketplace uses Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts to allow peers to communicate about the conditions of data sharing and perform the data exchange itself. For example, this platform will make me able to sell my facebook data to a company and provide service to me for  bargaining about the price as well as  including my privacy preferences and constraints into the deal. The peer-to-peer interaction for monetary and privacy related will be done by agents where agents \u201cmachine learn\u201d the preferences of their owners (i.e.,  the peers). 1 - 2 students.

Available simulation environments, the best known perhaps CARLA, focus mainly on realistically looking (photorealistic) appearance of the rendered scenes. They are very well suited for testing computer vision methods (the main perception component in autonomous driving) as well as for testing so-called end-to-end approaches for driving a car. In contrast to this, the present project assumes that a close-to-perfect perception component for the car's environment is already existing, leading to a detailed and precise so-called 'grid map' representation of the dynamic scene around the car. This is what also has (almost) been achieved in the automotive industry. The remaining challenges are more about how to act as a (simulated) driver, \u00a0if perfect knowledge about your environment is given. The main research questions to be addressed when such a simulator is available (as the result of the project proposed here) build on this available grid map representation and deal with the question how to steer and control a car in a dense traffic situation, e.g. in an urban environment during rush hours. In order to allow for this, it is needed to use very realistic vehicle models (which can be bought as 'assets' from the web) and use the same 'intelligent driving agent' an many exemplars of such cyber cars. 'Many' starts from, say, 10 cars, and could go up to several hundred ones, depending on the available computing ressources. In order to create this, a given game engine (currently envisaged: Unity) has to be enabled to be run in kind of a multi-user game fashion, and a realistic, urban-like road network has to be created. The challenge of this project is not photorealism in the visualization of the scene, but the creation of a realistic physics based model of a complex traffic scene, the creation of multiple car-centered abstract representations of the dynamic situation around each single car, and the implementation of an upscalable multi-user multi-agent simulation. In other words: this is not about creating photorealistic videos and processing them, but rather than that, this is about a dynamic simulation of traffic on the basis of a 3D structure representation of the scene. If desired, the project student(s) could also try out control schemes based on e.g. reinforement learning in order to show the overall functionality of the simulator, but the main purpose and goal of the project is the creation of the simulator.

Thus emphasis is not on speed, but on 'intelligence', behaviour, and autonomy. Parallel to this project which needs to first address the mechatronics and the main on-board computing used for communication and control, there is a another project dealing with developing the 'perception component' for the mobile robot. In the ideal case, the students of the \"mobile platform\" (=this project) and the \"perception unit\" projects would cooperate closely, but each project can also be executed individually. Important: the project could also be redefined, in agreement between the supervisor and the student(s) to put most emphasis on the software side of the mobile robot, behaviour, and 'intelligence'. This means that the robot stays closer to a suitable commercial platform to be selected and procured, and the electric and electromechanic work is reduced to the minimum necessary.

In case of this project being performed as a Masters project, it would be expected that also at least implementing a part of the robot's intelligent capabilities is included in the agreed project goals. This could be vision, but it could also be on the side of interaction with humans, e.g. some speech or speech understanding capabilities.

However, studies have shown incorporating clinical text can improve sepsis detection [1,2].  To better utilize clinical text for understanding underlying sepsis signs and symptoms, a small annotated corpus and knowledge model for sepsis is currently being developed using adverse event reports.  These adverse event reports contain notes which document incidents that have caused harm to a patient at the hospital. The main objective of this project is to classify different types of infections related to catheters using adverse event notes and the knowledge model [3]. Because adverse event reports contain many different events, there are possibilities to focus on other aspects such as but not limited:. 1. Use machine learning methods to classify other events not related to catheters and infection events in adverse event notes [4].. 2. Create an ontology for knowledge representation of infection and catheter [5].. 3. Create a Norwegian clinical BERT embedding using adverse event notes [6].. 4.

However, this approach is questionable for e.g. these reasons: Lack of isolation between in-kernel components results in security problems. Upgrading single components of the system tends to be difficult due to close coupling of the components Lack of isolation between in-kernel components results in security problems Upgrading single components of the system tends to be difficult due to close coupling of the components Liedtke has shown with L4 [1] that building an OS based on a minimal kernel, called microkernel, is not only feasible, but also competitive from a performance point of view. However, functionality built on top of a microkernel still tends to be quite monolithic, such as L4Linux [2]. An improved architecture would, however, use a multi-server system approach, in which each of the services of the OS running on top of the microkernel, such as file systems, memory management, and network protocols, run in a separate process, communicating via IPC (inter-process communication) messages over defined protocols only. microkernel microkernel multi-server multi-server Project topic Project topic In this project, we intend to investigate the challenges involved in re-engineering (i.e. splitting and rearranging) an existing operating system to run as a multi-server system on top of a microkernel. The system to be re-engineered is one of the Plan 9/Inferno family of operating systems [3], which themselves use a (more complex than L4 IPC, but still simple) protocol called 9p [4] to enable interaction between components. A research challenge here would be to enable L4 to also act as a messaging multiplexer for the 9p protocol, which would possibly lead to network transparency of such a multi-server OS. 9p An old monolithic research version of Plan 9 running on the L4 microkernel already exists [5] which could be used as basis for this project or inspiration.

This model is centralized AI, which is working fine now. But in the long-run it could lead to monopolization of the AI market. This could also cause unfair pricing,  lack of transparency, interoperability, privacy issues and excluding smaller companies from AI innovation. Fortunately, there is the emergence of a decentralized AI market, born at the intersection of blockchain, on-device AI and edge computing/IoT.\nIn this project, we will investigate the possibility to build a proof-of-concept of a decentralized AI application through blockchain, such as Ethereum.

Once the plastic reaches the oceans, it is broken down into smaller particles(micro-plastic) by being exposed to ultra violet (UV) radiation and mechanical abrasion from wave actions [1].The quantity of plastic waste floating at the ocean surface in 2013 was estimated to be approximately 269,000 tonnes (small macro- to micro-plastic), this estimate does not include plastic in-depth or at the seafloor). The plastic debris can affect the wildlife in multiple ways, such as entanglement- entrapping, encircling, or constricting,ingestion- accidental ingestion or ingestion of prey containing plastic, and interaction- being in contact with plastic debris [1].It is therefore important to be able to detect and collect the plastic waste in nature,before it reaches the oceans. Once plastic waste has reaches a micro-stadium, it is near impossible to collect it and remove it from the water. An analysis on deep sea locations(range from 1176 to 4843m) showed that there was an average abundance of 1 micro-plastic per 25cm3(particle sizes ranging from 75 to 161\u03bcm) [2] The AI-task will support the observation and monitoring of plastic items\u200b at consumer side, such as cities, beaches..... We will monitor the geographic distribution of different types of plastic items in these areas. The data will be gathered by citizens in form of taking photos of plastic objects. The photos will be taken using an application on smart phones. The application will have an artificial intelligence (deep learning) algorithm specially tailored for recognition of the material type of the plastic in the photos. The combined information about the geographic distribution, plastic type, and the object type (e.g., bottle, bag) pertinent to plastic debris will be collected in a database which in turn will be statistically analyzed and visualized. The smart application will serve as a tool for empowering citizen science and will contribute to the increase of the awareness and collaboration of citizens towards mitigation of plastic pollution problem.

Slike oppgaver er typisk utformet p\u00e5 den m\u00e5ten at alle kodeliner som trengs for l\u00f8sningen, er gitt - men i omstokket rekkef\u00f8lge - slik at de m\u00e5 trekkes til riktig posisjon for \u00e5 f\u00e5 til en l\u00f8sning. Hvis \u00f8kt vanskegrad er \u00f8nskelig, kan oppgavene ogs\u00e5 inneholde distraktorer, dvs. kodelinjer som ikke skal brukes i l\u00f8sningen. For eksempel p\u00e5 Parsons problems, se f.eks.\u00a0https://www.codio.com/blog/parsons-problems Normalt har slike dra-og-slipp-oppgaver v\u00e6rt ment for \u00e5 l\u00f8ses individuelt. Ideen i dette prosjektet er \u00e5 se p\u00e5 mulige designl\u00f8sninger for \u00e5 f\u00e5 dra-og-slipp-oppgaver til \u00e5 fungere som en gruppeaktivitet, for l\u00e6ring, moro, eller kanskje ogs\u00e5 som et spill med et konkurranseaspekt. Dette vil inneb\u00e6re \u00e5 utvikle en l\u00f8sning hvor flere studenter over nettet kan samarbeide om l\u00f8sningen av slike problemer, f.eks. at 3-4 studenter skal l\u00f8se en slik oppgave sammen. Her kan det tenkes flere ulike varianter, f.eks. med og uten distraktorer som nevnt over. Et annet aspekt som kan variere, er hva studentene f\u00e5r utdelt av informasjon eller puslespillbiter. \"Alle f\u00e5r alt\" \u00a0vil v\u00e6re ett yttterpunkt, her vil alle studentene ha tilgang til alle kodelinjene som er utdelt. Dette har antageligvis noen klare fordeler med at hver deltager har mulighet til \u00e5 f\u00e5 oversikt over hele l\u00f8sningsrommet. Samtidig har det ogs\u00e5 potensielle ulemper. I programmering for nybegynnere kommer studentene inn med h\u00f8yst ulike forutsetninger. Noen har allerede hatt programmering som hobby i \u00e5revis eller har tatt valgfag i lavere utdanning. Andre er helt ferske. \"Alle f\u00e5r alt\" vil inneb\u00e6re at den flinkeste av studentene i en gruppe p\u00e5 3-4, raskt vil kunne skj\u00f8nne hele l\u00f8sningen, uten at de andre blir s\u00e6rlig involvert. Hvis studentene derimot f\u00e5r utdelt ulike puslespillbiter, og hver bare ser de man selv har f\u00e5tt utdelt, er ogs\u00e5 de svakere studentene n\u00f8dt til \u00e5 putte kodelinjer inn p\u00e5 riktig plass i l\u00f8sningsomr\u00e5det for at gruppen skal lykkes - og blir dermed mer aktivt involvert. Dette kan ogs\u00e5 n\u00f8dvendiggj\u00f8re mer kommunikasjon mellom gruppemedlemmene for \u00e5 l\u00f8se oppgaven (\"Hvilke kodelinjer har du?\"; \"Er det noen som har en if-setning?\"), slik at det kanskje ogs\u00e5 kan bli \u00f8velse i kommunikasjon og samarbeid, ikke bare en \u00f8velse i programmering. For eventuell spillifisering kunne man tenke seg at mange grupper a 3-4 studenter konkurrerer med hverandre om \u00e5 l\u00f8se samme oppgave, eksempel med poengscore basert p\u00e5 hvor kjapt man l\u00f8ser oppgaven, men med trekk for eventuelle feilfors\u00f8k slik at det ikke skal l\u00f8nne seg \u00e5 bare kjapt pr\u00f8ve og feile med ulike omstokkinger av koden.

Software systems have developed to the point that we use and depend upon them daily in the same way that we depend upon traditional infrastructures and utilities. The value of sensitive information in computer systems is constantly increasing, and the same can be said for the corresponding threats, but measures to reduce the resulting vulnerabilities are not developed at the same pace. The fundamental way of solving the security problem is by building secure software, defending against exploitation from the earliest stages of development, with a consistent maintenance of the \"security-push\" throughout the whole development life-cycle. Today's software development business requires high-speed software delivery from the development team. In order to provide fast delivery of products, organizations have made transformations from their conventional development approach to agile development methods in an attempt to increase the effectiveness of their software development. Agile software development has a huge impact on how software is developed worldwide, and Norway is leading the research in this area, where almost all software companies use agile methods. However, agile projects often focus on immediate business features and functionality over security requirements. There are no security engineering practices developed specifically for the agile processes. Thus, there is little evidence on how to implement security practices in agile software development. Science of Security (SoS) is an area of research that seeks to apply a scientific approach to the study and design of secure and trustworthy information systems. Goals Develop and apply innovative approaches, tools, and techniques for improving security in agile software development in Norway. Empirically understand how software systems can be elicited, designed, built, and maintained to systematically address security issues across an agile development lifecycle. Increase the maturity of the security of software developed in Norway. Foster collaboration within research and practice in order to advance the practice in secure software engineering.

Environmental researchers must therefore constantly manage the data \u2013 e.g., ensure that the sensors are calibrated and the environmental data are made trustworthy, readable, and meaningful with respect to the context. Key questions that this project will address are: What is the role of the sensors and the work of environmental researchers, to ensure that the data can be shared and reused over the long term? What role can new ICT solutions such as service platforms play in this scenario? This project consists of two part:. 1. A review of the academic literature, to identify the main challenges of sensor data management; . 2. A qualitative study, including interviews and observations, of sensor data management activities at one or more environmental research sites in Norway and/or abroad. Number of site visits and language of data collection can be agreed upon with the supervisor.   We recommend that the candidate conducts this study over one year, or as a combination of Autumn project (part 1) and master thesis (part 2). The project is suitable for one or two students.

Detailed project description. The overall goal of this problem is for Kahoot! to learn more about the content being created on its platform, and use this learning to create a better experience for its users. The majority of user-generated content on the Kahoot!. platform consists of true information being used to teach, engage and learn. By enriching this content, Kahoot! may support its users in several ways, for instance: Detailed project description   Wrong answer suggestions: multiple choices require crafting wrong answers. For instance, with questions like \u201cWhat\u2019s the capital of Norway?\u201d, wrong answers which aren\u2019t too obvious can be Bergen, Trondheim, Stockholm. Bad answers can be apple, sea, dog. By giving suggestions to the users on good answer alternatives, the users can concentrate more on the actual content.. \u00a0Learning made more complete: with users creating kahoots on all sorts of topics, some kahoots may be missing crucial questions for the learners to understand the whole picture of a topic.

Giving the content creator suggestions on questions or topic areas related to the created quiz can make the learning process more complete for the audience. Unlike the classic Kahoot! live game, Kahoot! challenges are self-paced and are not limited by the users\u2019 location or time. Questions and answers are displayed on the learners\u2019 device and they can complete the challenge at their own pace. When users have finished a challenge, new challenges for the users to take can be recommended, for instance: Topic completion: For instance, a user may have a lot of interest in geography. By analyzing kahoots created in the field of geography, other kahoots needed for the user to become a geography expert can be suggested.. Logical next step: Similarly, we could identify common learning paths and help suggest logical next steps. Topic completion: For instance, a user may have a lot of interest in geography. By analyzing kahoots created in the field of geography, other kahoots needed for the user to become a geography expert can be suggested. Logical next step: Similarly, we could identify common learning paths and help suggest logical next steps. To achieve all of these suggestions, Kahoot! needs a way of extracting information from all kahoots created and combining information with other sources of information using a structured knowledge base, for example Wikipedia. All information may then be stored in a hierarchical knowledge graph to be used by future algorithms or analyses. Named-entity recognition algorithms may subsequently be used to analyze the content. Combining this analysis and the knowledge graph, sophisticated and valuable suggestions and future functionality may be made for the users.

Such an algorithm shall be used to identify the current knowledge of students, allowing thus for formative interventions and identification of gaps in their knowledge. Moreover, such tools are expected to be useful to identify areas in the course that need improvement, and thus provide feedback also to the teacher. The student(s) will work to design, implement and evaluate a web application module that can be used by professors, teaching assistants, and students alike. The students should contribute with novel and original ways to deal with the various requirements and especially with the visualization of the data throughout the semester. The student(s) will have to work with the main stakeholders for eliciting requirements.

This project is a joint project of Akvaplan-niva AS and NTNU.\n\nProblem description: In recent years, the use of Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) for research and mitigation purposes has dramatically increased, with new studies encouraging its use. Acoustic data provide scientific insights in a broad range of fields including animal vocalizations (biophony) and anthropogenic noise (anthrophony) in the marine environment. Yet, the amount of human effort required to manually identify acoustic features and events rapidly becomes limiting as the size of the data sets increase. Machine learning has the potential to handle large data sets and address many questions in the field of passive acoustic such as automatic detection and classification of sound events. However, the sound from these sources reverberates in the environment which profoundly distorts the original source waveform or can be masked by other sounds overlapping in time and frequencies. Thus the signal recorded usually contains a mixture of highly variable unknown sources, each distorted by the environment in an unknown fashion. Moreover, the noise produced by system events of unmanned autonomous vehicles (gliders) while carrying the hydrophones can saturate the recordings. This issue can mask the detections. Some of the suggested objectives: \u2022 Develop an automatic system able to detect and identify non-biological sound sources. \u2022 Detection of events with time overlap between biotic and abiotic sound sources. \u2022 Develop an algorithm able to automatically identify and filter out the noise events produced by the gliders To achieve the above goals, this project is divided into the following sub-projects: I. Investigate the possibility of applying existing state-of-the-art deep learning methods to solve the above tasks. As part of this, the candidate is expected to perform a state-of-the-art literature review and implement the most relevant method(s) to create automatic detector(s) that can solve the problem. II.

Intermittent computing [1] is the general name of a research area that develops and implements methods to enable software to run on systems with interrupted power supply without having to restart. In the context of this project, you will investigate possibilities of making intermittent computing IoT applications adaptable to varying amounts of available energy using program slicing [2], a compiler technique that splits programs into semantically related subprograms. The idea here is to enable the flexible reduction of a program's functionality depending on the amount of energy available. The maximum energy consumption of program slices can be determined by applying worst-case energy consumption analyses (WCEC) [3]. Using WCEC information obtained at compile time, the runtime (operating system) can then be enabled to execute only important parts of an IoT\u00a0application if insufficient energy is available for executing a complete iteration of the code. Your initial task will be to analyze typical IoT\u00a0benchmark applications as to whether slicing is a useful approach. Based on a selection of useful benchmarks, you will then define slicing criteria and implement slicing analyses and transformations. Depending on the number of students working on the project, additional steps would be to enable WCEC analysis and to extend a simple embedded OS to schedule program slices depending on runtime energy availability. Useful prerequisited for working on this project are experience with C/C++ programming, some background in computer architecture/assembler programming (processor instruction sets and runtime/energy modelling), and ideally compiler/static analysis techniques. Embedded systems experience and experience with open-source compiler toolchains (clang/LLVM) is not required but would be beneficial.

Each student (or couple of students) will study a sub theme of the theme SE and AI, study the literature, plan an empirical investigation to collect data from processes that involve software engineers and software companies. Context:. The rapid diffusion of digital information technologies has created an explosive growth in the amount of digital data. Data is a key asset to compete in today\u2019s business. Digitalization is concerned with using software and data to offer significantly improved products, pure software products as well as digital and data driven services. The intent is to create new revenue opportunities as well as replace traditional business models with new business models. Driving the digital transformation is especially challenging as it brings with it the rapid sequence of three technologies that build on each other, i.e. software, data and artificial intelligence (AI). Although traditionally the focus has been on software, increasingly the latter topics are becoming more important. It is data that allow us to generate insights that are far from obvious to the human mind and to detect patterns in large amounts of data that are elusive otherwise. AI and specially machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), provide technology to identify these patterns in data and then act on these patterns to deliver solutions that were unfeasible before or that function much better with the use of AI.  To be able to handle the challenges of AI engineering, the software development needs to change. The organizations will need to change their business models, as well as business strategy, the architecture of products, systems and services, ways of working, processes and tools as well as organizational structure of the company. The demand for innovation now, calls for a revolutionary mindset that combines skillsets that are not traditionally found in software teams. Software engineering as a critical core capability where best practices are changing rapidly. With the pervasive use and the dependence on AIbased systems, the quality of these systems becomes essential for their practical usage. However, quality assurance for AI-based systems is an emerging area that has not been well explored and requires collaboration between the SE and AI research communities. The objective of this thesis is to understand and create approaches for companies to do quality assurance of AI Based Systems.

Problem description Problem description Problem description Today,\u00a0IoT devices and the related services are interconnected in the Cloud. This causes a number of problems for users of these devices: Difficulty of data protection and privacy Difficulty of data protection and privacy  Sensitive data from personal IoT devices is stored in Cloud infrastructures today. This includes, e.g., personal health data from fitness trackers and smartwatches, geoloation by all sorts of devices including cars, or room occupancy information provided by smart thermometers. It is unclear who has legitimately (e.g. an insurance company raising your premiums when it induces an \"unhealty\" lifestyle or \"dangerous\" driving from data obtained from your devices) or illegitimately (e.g. burglars using data from your devices to find out when you are not at home) obtained access to your data and what is done with it. A decentralized IoT Cloud would enable the device user to exert\u00a0control over where their data is stored and how it can be used. This can, e.g., be achieved by new operating system and runtime infrastructures built for privacy. This part of the project will investigage these novel structures, based on network-centric operating systems such as Plan 9 and Inferno. Bad sustainability due to forced obsolescence Bad sustainability due to forced obsolescence  The problem of requiring centralized services in the Cloud has an additional implication. Many IoT devices are incapable of working in a standalone mode. This has the consequence that devices turn into e-waste as soon as the related service is no longer available. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that many device manufacturers cease to provide software updates after only a few years - for long-living devices such as washing machines or cares, this can significantly reduce their useful lifetime. In this part of the project, we will provide a system software infrastructure to enable the movement of services for IoT devices from the Cloud to local servers (e.g. a Raspberry Pi home server) and to enable standalone operation of IoT devices - possibly with reduced functionality. This involved using a software platform that allows to move services, e.g. a language-level virtual machine. One of the challenges here is to enable such a system to run on typically resource-constrained IoT hardware systems. Prerequisites Prerequisites Prerequisites Knowledge of system-level programming (e.g. courses on compilers, low-level programming and operating systems) and embedded systems would be a plus. Obviously, experience with software and network infrastructures for the IoT is beneficial.

One goal of the project is to find a set of tweets that are rich in figurative language,  another goal is to determine whether the writer of each such tweet has expressed a positive or negative sentiment, and possibly the degree to which this sentiment has been communicated. For the data collection part, the project could tentatively build on data sets from the Semantic Evaluation (SemEval) shared task exercises, in particular the tweets annotated for figurative language in SemEval-15 (Task 11) and those annotated for sarcasm in the SemEval tasks on Twitter sentiment analysis (Sem-14 Task 9, SemEval-15 Task 10, SemEval-16 Task 4).

The challenge is to infer the shape of physically occluded objects, with parts inaccessible to the visual sensor. For humans, inferring the full 3D \u00ac\u00acshape of objects from a single view based on previous knowledge and experiences, is easy. This thesis is a continuation of the Masters thesis by P. S. Bergebakken (2020-2021) which developed a 3D shape completion framework for segmented single-view data, based on learning deep implicit surfaces. The challenge is to extend this framework to handle processing of unsegmented live streaming data from a camera mounted on a robot arm and adapt it to the robot\u2019s environment. Following tasks are envisaged:. 1.\tLiterature review to enrich the existing shape completion approach.. 2.\tExtend and retrain the existing model to incorporate object classification, panoptic segmentation and possible depth image hole infilling and upscaling.. 3.\tIntegration of the model into the C++ robot control environment and enable inference from live point cloud and image data from a RGB-D camera.. 4.\tExperimentation with how object classification data and other scene context information can aid generation of better 3D shape reconstructions.. 5.\tDemonstration of the framework with 3D reconstruction of random objects from a single view retrieved from a scene with a) freehand RGB-D camera; b) RGB-D camera mounted on a Panda Emika 7-DoF arm.

A predictable alternative to caches is the use of small, fast and efficient software-managed on-chip memories, so-called scratchpad memories (SPMs) or tightly-couple memories (TCMs) [1]. Like caches, these memories are used to store commonly accessed code and data. In contrast to caches, the contents of SPMs are defined by software. This allows a SPM content management algorithm to copy relevant contents from and to main memory as required. SPM management also allows to implement additional features. For example, data in main memory can be compressed or encrypted on demand. Another possible feature would be to implement selective redundancy by storing data in main memory using software-based ECC codes [2] or other methods of redundancy to protect data against main memory errors. Your task will be to design and implement a framework for SPM data management that is able to execute this additional functionality on demand, e.g. as defined by static compiler analyses. The platform will be a typical high-end microcontroller system, e.g. ARM Cortex-M7/M33 or RISC V-based. Interesting challenges in this project will be to handle changing addresses for statically (global) as well as dynamically allocated (stack) data [3] and to ensure data consistency when data is moved between main memory and the SPM while a program runs. Useful prerequisites for working on this project are experience with C/C++ programming, some background in computer architecture/assembler programming, and basics of compilers. Embedded systems experience and experience with open-source compiler toolchains (clang/LLVM) is not required but would be beneficial. [1] R. Banakar, S. Steinke, Bo-Sik Lee, M. Balakrishnan and P.

Each student (or couple of students) will study a sub theme of the theme SE and children, study the literature, plan an empirical investigation to collect data from processes that involve software engineers and software companies. Context: The rapid diffusion of digital information technologies has created an explosive growth in the amount of digital data. Data is a key asset to compete in today\u2019s business. Digitalization is concerned with using software and data to offer significantly improved products, pure software products as well as digital and data driven services. The intent is to create new revenue opportunities as well as replace traditional business models with new business models. Driving the digital transformation is especially challenging as it brings with it the rapid sequence of three technologies that build on each other, i.e. software, data and artificial intelligence (AI). Although traditionally the focus has been on software, increasingly the latter topics are becoming more important. It is data that allow us to generate insights that are far from obvious to the human mind and to detect patterns in large amounts of data that are elusive otherwise. AI and specially machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), provide technology to identify these patterns in data and then act on these patterns to deliver solutions that were unfeasible before or that function much better with the use of AI. To be able to handle the challenges of AI engineering, the software development needs to change. The organizations will need to change their business models, as well as business strategy, the architecture of products, systems and services, ways of working, processes and tools as well as organizational structure of the company. The demand for innovation now, calls for a revolutionary mindset that combines skillsets that are not traditionally found in software teams. Software engineering as a critical core capability where best practices are changing rapidly. Because the work practice around building and integrating machine learning into software and services is still emerging and is not uniform across all product teams, there is no systematic way to identify the key stakeholders on the topic of adoption. The way organizations structure the teams to work with AI Engineering is a challenge, first because it is not a \u201ctraditional\u201d way of developing software and second, there is a shortage of data analytics in the market, and it is not clear yet what is the demand of workload that will be needed for each software team. There is also little knowledge on  how to effectively have the different roles working together, we have to find ways that the data analysts works together with the software development teams and vice versa. To gain value from data analytics inside software development teams requires a strong data science skillset and there simply aren\u2019t that many people around that have this skillset. Training existing staff to become proficient in data science skills is quite challenging and most certainly harder than providing machine learning education to engineers and developers. Many in the industry believe that artificial intelligence applications, and especially machine and deep-learning models, suffer from the same challenges.

My side of the project involves the fundamental software infrastructure as well as new approaches for programming autonomous mobile robots. Details Details Modern robots no longer rely on a centralized processor, but use a complex, heterogeneous distributed networked system. This project will be a part of our project to construct the hard- and software for such a mobile, autonomous robot. Nodes in the robot system will include high-performance systems such as NVidia Jetson for image processing, coordinating nodes such as Raspberry Pis, as well as small-scale embedded microcontrollers such as Arm Cortex-M for controlling simple sensors and actuators. In this part of the projects, there are two major challenges: Creating a communication infrastructure to interconnect all devices. This includes problems such as persistency of communication (due to energy preservation modes for some devices) and also real-time synchronization (to enable sensor fusion for autonomous devices, e.g. combining camera, Lidar and ultrasonic data).. Enabling the robot end user to program the robot without requiring knowledge about C programming, networking or distributed systems. This part of the project involves mapping the distributed system to a graphical representation, e.g. StateCharts, so abstract solutions to autonomous robotics projects can be easily developed. You might have seen something similar for Lego MindStorms systems (this is based on LabView) - we intend to use this idea to enable the simple programming of a complex autonomous robot.

This is an umbrella project that can result in of a number of subtopics for specific projects. Accordingly, the specific topics will be defined in details together with the interested student(s). Please get in touch with me for further information and/or discussing details. Prerequisites Prerequisites Prerequisites Knowledge of system-level programming (e.g. courses on compilers, low-level programming and operating systems) and embedded systems would be a plus. Obviously, experience with software and communication infrastructures for embedded systems is beneficial. These projects are research-intensive and heavily rely on your interests and ideas to find interesting new solutions - so a high level of motivation for the topic is expected.

Each student (or couple of students) will study a sub theme of the theme SE and children, study the literature, plan an empirical investigation to collect data from processes that involve software engineers. Context: . Massive and ever growing amount of software is available today to children of younger and younger age through sites such as Facebook and Instagram, apps, and games. Children are increasingly using software intensive technologies. In some cases, the software is specifically made for solving a problem, like helping children with reading difficulties to learn how to read [5] or children with obesity to exercise [3]. In other cases, the software is made to enhance children creativity [8], like Scratch [10]. In most cases, software is made for commercial purposes and for entertaining children, like Callof Duty.  It is harder and hard to keep up with threats and vulnerabilities associated with these tools, apps or websites, especially for children. In the recent years we have assisted to a series of problems generated by the use of software by children. Children can fall victim to cyber security threats like social engineering, cyber bullying, hacking, viruses, and damaging malware, cyber stalking, etc. through search engines, online advertisements and social networking websites such as Facebook, Twitter and lots of other websites [4]. Mental health issues and even suicide are been caused by interaction with software. Instagram removed nearly 10,000 images related to suicide and self harm every day in the months following the Molly Russell scandal (according to https://www.telegraph.co.uk). Physical health issues, like obesity [12] and diabetes are been caused by use of videogames. Given the greater exposure of children to these technologies, the design research community takes into account children\u2019s abilities, interests, and developmental needs [6] when designing interfaces of software for children. In previous studies we have addressed creativity software for children [9]; exergames [3]; and software for motivating adolescents with Intellectual Disabilities [7]. As far as our knowledge, a categorization of software for children which balance creativity, security, and the various dimensions of child well-being (physical, mental, and social) have not been proposed. Ethics, privacy, explanability, cybersecurity, and children well-being will have to be integral part of the processes, so that the children who use software systems will be offered new possibilities and made aware of threads.  An emphasis will be put on studying existing software practices in software companies that develop software that are used by children and develop a set of enablers(or characteristics) for good software security for children. The student(s) will: Run a literature review Plan and Run an empirical investigation (data collection, data analysis) with software engineers as subjects Propose a solution to a problem as an artefact Paper Writing for Conference, like ICSE Society Track The supervisor will provide the student(s) with Initial Literature and help the student(s) to access to Stakeholders and initial data for the Empirical Investigation . If the project will be run as a 15 + 30 project, I expect that during the Autumn semester the student(s) will implement steps 1 and 2 and during Spring Semester steps 3,4,5. . The supervisor wish to interact with the master students and organize workshops and supervision sessions weekly.   References . [1] S. Easterbrook, J. Singer, M.-A. Storey, and D. Damian.

B\u00f8ndene slipper sauene ut p\u00e5 fritt beite rundt midten av mai og sanker de inn igjen fra september og til sn\u00f8en legger seg. I denne tiden g\u00e5r sauen fritt i skog og fjell med tilsyn i prinsippet en gang i uka. Sanking av sauene om h\u00f8sten er en flertrinnsoperasjon som normalt tar et antall uker. Man g\u00e5r oftest gjennom et par runder per hovedbeiteomr\u00e5de hvor de aller fleste sauene lokaliseres og drives hjem til g\u00e5rden. Dernest f\u00f8lger en fase hvor de siste skal lokaliseres og bringes hjem. Denne siste fasen er oftest langvarig og arbeidskrevende da man ofte ikke har noen god formening om hvor sauene befinner seg. Systemet vi skal utvikle har prim\u00e6rt til hensikt \u00e5 effektivisere lokaliseringen av disse siste sauene slik at sauebonden kan spare det meste av det sv\u00e6rt tidkrevende s\u00f8kearbeidet.

Radioen skal sende ut et \u00abping\u00bb med jevne mellomrom som kan fanges opp av en drone. . Man benytter en flydrone til \u00e5 s\u00f8ke etter sauene over et stort areal. N\u00e5r flydronen mottar et signal fra en eller flere sauer, registrerer den sin egen GPS-posisjon. Vi vet da et sauen befinner seg innenfor en radius av 300 til 500 meter i forhold til dronens posisjon. Det vil ogs\u00e5 v\u00e6re mulig \u00e5 m\u00e5le avstanden til sauen ved \u00e5 g\u00e5 over i s\u00e5kalt \u00abranging-modus\u00bb s\u00e5 snart en har mottatt signal fra sauen.

State-of-the-art systems are reasonably successful at generating images of single objects, but struggle to generate images of more complex scenes (e.g., of interacting objects) and higher resolutions images. Currently utilised techniques are mostly based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where one neural network generates images while a second network (the descriminator) tries to separate generated images from genuine ones, with both networks aiming to improve over time based on the their success. Within text-to-image generation, the generator can get additional feedback through re-generating of text from the generated images. The thesis project would target further improvements in the field, in particular the generation of complex scenes at high resolutions, by investigating better text analysis and re-generation techniques.

Software systems have developed to the point that we use and depend upon them daily in the same way that we depend upon traditional infrastructures and utilities. The value of sensitive information in computer systems is constantly increasing, and the same can be said for the corresponding threats, but measures to reduce the resulting vulnerabilities are not developed at the same pace. The fundamental way of solving the security problem is by building secure software, defending against exploitation from the earliest stages of development, with a consistent maintenance of the \"security-push\" throughout the whole development life-cycle. Today's software development business requires high-speed software delivery from the development team. In order to provide fast delivery of products, organizations have made transformations from their conventional development approach to agile development methods in an attempt to increase the effectiveness of their software development. Agile software development has a huge impact on how software is developed worldwide, and Norway is leading the research in this area, where almost all software companies use agile methods. However, agile projects often focus on immediate business features and functionality over security requirements. There are no security engineering practices developed specifically for the agile processes. Thus, there is little evidence on how to implement security practices in agile software development. Science of Security (SoS) is an area of research that seeks to apply a scientific approach to the study and design of secure and trustworthy information systems. Goals Develop and apply innovative approaches, tools, and techniques for improving security in agile software development in Norway. Empirically understand how software systems can be elicited, designed, built, and maintained to systematically address security issues across an agile development lifecycle. Increase the maturity of the security of software developed in Norway. Foster collaboration within research and practice in order to advance the practice in secure software engineering.

Each student (or couple of students) will study a sub theme of the theme SE and children, study the literature, plan an empirical investigation to collect data from processes that involve children, software and possibly software engineers. Context: . Massive and ever growing amount of software is available today to children of younger and younger age through sites such as Facebook and Instagram, apps, and games. Children are increasingly using software intensive technologies. In some cases, the software is specifically made for solving a problem, like helping children with reading difficulties to learn how to read [5] or children with obesity to exercise [3]. In other cases, the software is made to enhance children creativity [8], like Scratch [10]. In most cases, software is made for commercial purposes and for entertaining children, like Callof Duty.. It is getting difficult every day to keep up with threats and vulnerabilities associated with these tools, apps or websites, especially for children. In the recent years we have assisted to a series of problems generated by the use of software by children. These problems arise from the use of both general software like Facebook and Instagram and specific software for children. Children can fall victim to cyber security threats like social engineering, cyber bullying, hacking, viruses, and damaging malware, cyber stalking, etc. through search engines, online advertisements and social networking websites such as Facebook, Twitter and lots of other websites [4]. Mental health issues and even suicide are been caused by interaction with software. Instagram removed nearly 10,000 images related to suicide and self harm every day in the months following the Molly Russell scandal(according to https://www.telegraph.co.uk). Physical health issues, like obesity [12] and diabetes are been caused by use of videogames.. Given the greater exposure of children to these technologies, the design research community takes into account children\u2019s abilities, interests, and developmental needs [6] when designing interfaces of software for children. In previous studies we have addressed creativity software for children [9]; exergames [3]; and software for motivating adolescents with Intellectual Disabilities [7]. As far as our knowledge, a categorization of software for children which balance creativity, security, and the various dimensions of child well-being (physical, mental, and social) have not been proposed. An emphasis will be put on studying existing software for children and develop a set of enablers(or characteristics) for good software for children. Ethics, privacy, explanability, cybersecurity, and children well-being will have to be integral part of the processes, so that the children who use software systems will be offered new possibilities and made aware of threads.    The student(s) will:. Run a systematic literature review and prepare a paper for journal. Plan an empirical investigation. Run an empirical investigation (data collection, data analysis) with children and/or software engineers as subjects. Propose Software Engineering Process with children as stakeholders . Paper Writing for Conference, like ICSE Society Track      The supervisor will provide the student(s) with Initial Literature and help the student(s) to access to Stakeholders and initial data for the Empirical Investigation. If the project will be run as a 15 + 30 project, I expect that during the Autumn semester the student(s) will implement steps 1 and 2 and during Spring Semester steps 3,4,5.. The supervisor wish to interact with the master students and organize workshops and supervision sessions weekly.   References. [1] S. Easterbrook, J. Singer, M.-A. Storey, and D. Damian.

Language evolution is a highly multi-disciplinary research field with the main theories involving biological evolution, language learning, and cultural evolution. When trying to understand the origins of languages, we can try to compensate for the lack of empirical evidence by utilising evolutionary computational methods to create simulations of how language may have evolved over time, e.g., by creating \"language games\" to simulate communication between agents in a social setting. In general, simulations on language evolution tend to have relatively small and fixed population sizes, something this study could aim to change.

AI components will produce feedback mechanisms, which may be delivered directly to the learner, or to their educational facilitator.  Thesis Description. In a first step, the student needs to review the literature and familiarize themself with multimodal dashboard system. Then, the candidate will conceptualise and implement AI components to drive feedback mechanisms which support the learner during learning activities (directly or via their educational facilitator). Afterwards, the candidate will conduct a user study to empirically test the proposed AI components. Finally, the candidate will analyse the collected data and write up their thesis.  Requirements. The ideal candidate will have a background in AI, user experience and interface design. Front-end programming skills (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) and an interest in hands-on development (Python) and. experimentation is also a requirement.   Programming skills: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

The project consists of a literature review in the area which will help narrow down the topic. This will directly impact the empirical part of the thesis, that will also be based on the students\u2019 interests. The second phase includes designing an empirical study and collect data employing qualitative and/or quantitative methods.

To facilitate a correct device deployment the relationship between the anatomy and the position of the instruments has to be known and presented to the surgeon. The position of the instruments and the geometry of the vascular tree is best visualized on Xray images, with a wide field of view, however the resulting images are 2D projections of the 3D world for a given a position of the X-ray source. On the other hand the heart\u2019s anatomy is very well depicted using ultrasound images (e.g. 3D transesophageal ultrasound - TEE), however these images have a much smaller field of view due to the positioning of the TEE probe with regards to the heart. Therefore, tools that can automatically identify the position and orientation of the ultrasound probe and cathethers in X-ray images as well as automatic localization of anatomic structures of interest is highly desirable. Today most of these tasks are solved manually or semi-automatically, however automating them would improve the accuracy and also reduce the amount of time the interventionalists spend on aligning the images. We propose three topics for master theses all related to interventional applications of ultrasound imaging. They are:. - AI for ultrasound probe detection in X-ray images, the task will be to identify the location of the ultrasound probe but also its pose  - AI for catheter detection in the ultrasound volume and highlight of it in the image. The goal is to automatically detect catheter, delivery device and artificial devices (like MitraClip or artificial valves). Those objects give somewhat different echo signals but not always very clear nor complete. The task will be to detect automatically such objects within 3D ultrasound datasets. - AI for aortic valve detection in mitral trans esophageal acquisitions of the heart. Previous work supervised by Gabriel Kiss have been focusing on automatically detecting the mitral valve in 3D ultrasound data. This project aims at also detecting the aortic valve. The ultimate goal is automatic detection of anatomical structures running very fast (real-time if possible), so that the 3D data could automatic be presented in a way that makes sense to the physician, by rotating, cropping the 3D data based on the information detected in the images.

Classification of movement characteristics and movement patterns in spontaneous movements in young infants has in recent years been presented as the most accurate method for early identification of infants who will later develop serious motor problems and reduced motor function (like cerebral palsy). Today, characteristic of such normal and abnormal infant spontaneous movement could be objectively captured and processed by computer software from video recordings but the procedures are so far too imprecise, cumbersome and time consuming for clinical use (see here for more information).  here Based on a database of 1400 video recordings at St. Olav\u2019s University Hospital of infants at risk of neurological dysfunctions from multiple sites worldwide, in particular Norway, USA and India, this student assignment aims at solving the following tasks: To identify risk-related movement patterns in video predicting later outcome of motor disabilities..

Supervised learning requires data instances annotated with the correct output labels, but the other paradigms assume no such labelled data. Reinforcement learning is primarily concerned with what actions an intelligent agent (or group of agents) should take in a specified environment in order to maximise some cumulative reward, while simultaneously exploring the environment and exploiting previously accumulated knowledge. The environment is commonly formulated as a Markov decision process or as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), depending on whether the agent can observe the current environmental state directly or whether the observed states are distorted by noise. Reinforcement learning agents have shown strong performance on classical games, making this an interesting approach to test in general in the context of computational creativity. However, a creative \u201cgame\u201d type setting using the standard Monte Carlo algorithm can be a time-consuming process. An alternative can then be to utilise strategies that combine ideas from neural network type set-ups with evolutionary approaches (e.g., compositional pattern-producing networks; Stanley 2007) or model-free reinforcement learning such as Q-learning (or deep Q-learning as introduced by Google DeepMind; Mnih et al. 2015, Silver et al. 2018), which only learns the value of an action in a particular state (stochastic transitions and rewards), without having a model of the environment.

Once the plastic reaches the oceans, it is broken down into smaller particles(micro-plastic) by being exposed to ultra violet (UV) radiation and mechanical abrasion from wave actions [1].The quantity of plastic waste floating at the ocean surface in 2013 was estimated to be approximately 269,000 tonnes (small macro- to micro-plastic), this estimate does not include plastic in-depth or at the seafloor). The plastic debris can affect the wildlife in multiple ways, such as entanglement- entrapping, encircling, or constricting,ingestion- accidental ingestion or ingestion of prey containing plastic, and interaction- being in contact with plastic debris [1].It is therefore important to be able to detect and collect the plastic waste in nature,before it reaches the oceans. Once plastic waste has reaches a micro-stadium, it is near impossible to collect it and remove it from the water.

With over 5 billion cumulative players in the Kahoot! ecosystem, the amount of content stored on the platform is enormous. Kahoot! wants to enrich the content on the platform to build a better foundation for functionality like recommendations that will help improve end users\u2019 experience. Detailed project description. The overall goal of this problem is for Kahoot! to learn more about the content being created on its platform, and use this learning to create a better experience for its users. The majority of user-generated content on the Kahoot!. platform consists of true information being used to teach, engage and learn. By enriching this content, Kahoot! may support its users in several ways, for instance: Detailed project description   Wrong answer suggestions: multiple choices require crafting wrong answers. For instance, with questions like \u201cWhat\u2019s the capital of Norway?\u201d, wrong answers which aren\u2019t too obvious can be Bergen, Trondheim, Stockholm. Bad answers can be apple, sea, dog. By giving suggestions to the users on good answer alternatives, the users can concentrate more on the actual content.. \u00a0Learning made more complete: with users creating kahoots on all sorts of topics, some kahoots may be missing crucial questions for the learners to understand the whole picture of a topic.

Learning made more complete: with users creating kahoots on all sorts of topics, some kahoots may be missing crucial questions for the learners to understand the whole picture of a topic. Giving the content creator suggestions on questions or topic areas related to the created quiz can make the learning process more complete for the audience. Unlike the classic Kahoot! live game, Kahoot! challenges are self-paced and are not limited by the users\u2019 location or time. Questions and answers are displayed on the learners\u2019 device and they can complete the challenge at their own pace. When users have finished a challenge, new challenges for the users to take can be recommended, for instance: Topic completion: For instance, a user may have a lot of interest in geography. By analyzing kahoots created in the field of geography, other kahoots needed for the user to become a geography expert can be suggested.. Logical next step: Similarly, we could identify common learning paths and help suggest logical next steps. Topic completion: For instance, a user may have a lot of interest in geography. By analyzing kahoots created in the field of geography, other kahoots needed for the user to become a geography expert can be suggested. Logical next step: Similarly, we could identify common learning paths and help suggest logical next steps. To achieve all of these suggestions, Kahoot! needs a way of extracting information from all kahoots created and combining information with other sources of information using a structured knowledge base, for example Wikipedia. All information may then be stored in a hierarchical knowledge graph to be used by future algorithms or analyses. Named-entity recognition algorithms may subsequently be used to analyze the content. Combining this analysis and the knowledge graph, sophisticated and valuable suggestions and future functionality may be made for the users.

I denne tiden g\u00e5r sauen fritt i skog og fjell med tilsyn i prinsippet en gang i uka. Sanking av sauene om h\u00f8sten er en flertrinnsoperasjon som normalt tar et antall uker.

Most of the 3D FER state-of-the-art methods extract hand-crafted features [1-5], which could be considered as a digital signature of the face, and use them in order to compare different 3D faces through trained classifiers or similarity functions [6]. . The rise of deep learning networks tends to replace the hand-crafted features with features automatically extracted by the deep networks. Nonetheless, deep networks require large training datasets in order to converge and produce reliable results.. Up until recently, deep networks could not be sufficiently implemented in the case of 3D FER for two reasons: 1) lack of existence of large labelled 3D face datasets for training and 2) deep networks could not consume 3D data (3D meshes, point clouds etc.) as input.. The 1st issue has been solved with the improvement of the 3D data acquisition hardware. More and more 3D face datasets are produced [7-9], along with software capable of producing synthetic 3D face models [10], which can further augment the real data within a deep training process.. For resolving the 2nd issue, initially, the methodologies converted the actual 3D data into a 2D modality like depth images or geometry images [11, 12]. Thus making the data compatible with the existing deep networks. This is expected to change in the near future, due to the newest machine learning trend, the so-called Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) [13,14]. GDL introduces deep networks that can be fed with 3D meshes, point clouds and graphs. Thus, GDL models are very interesting to be studied in order to find out whether they can achieve a performance boost in terms of 3D FER evaluation measures, as they have already done in other computer vision applications..

When building object detectors for marine applications, it is particularly important to have training sets which do not only contain a sufficient number of relevant object classes (ships, piers, buoys, ...), but also show the different variations in lighting conditions, and weather conditions (fog, rain, snow, ...). As it is difficult, if practically possible at all, to record a sufficient number of such images or videos for training object detector networks, this project aims at artificially generating these variations of image conditions, in particular different illumination and strongly different weather conditions.\nImage augmentation is a well-known technique for synthetically expanding limited or imbalanced training datasets used in computer vision tasks to improve generalization performance and to avoid overfitting. Likewise, augmentations can be used for testing network generalization performance, by imposing varying augmentations, e.g. two-dimensional augmentations such as shifts, rotations, etc., as well as natural phenomena, e.g. snow, fog, lighting conditions, etc., or even adding synthetic objects to the scene. The former is straightforward using simple transformations in two dimensions, whereas the latter should imitate realistic, and highly stochastic, scenarios that in reality depends on the depth information of the scene. Nonetheless, this is often done by basic image manipulations imposed uniformly over the whole scene without considering depth information and may result in unrealistic augmentations not representing reality and could possibly produce erroneous testing performance. As an example, fog or rain may be observed only at a certain distance and/or area and affects only specific far-away objects, rather than all objects in the scene. The proposed research topic is therefore to investigate techniques for extracting depth information from images or video and taking advantage of this information to apply augmentations of natural phenomena in 3-Dimensions.\nFor the extraction of this 3D information, one can use recent methods of single image depth estimation by deep neural networks, or \"motion stereo\" from a moving camera (in case of video sequences). Both approaches can also be combined.\nTherefore, the first partial goal of this project is to explore methods for depth estimation for given training images or videos.\nThe second goal is to use the extracted estimate of the depth structure to simulate the desired weather and illumination situation, such as fog, rain, or snow. Again, this can be done by \"classical\" physics-based computer graphics modeling, and/or by suitably trained deeep neural networks.\nAnother important aspect is to benchmark 2D and 3D synthetic augmentations against images containing actual natural phenomena\u2019s, i.e. network performance on synthetic scenes against true scenes.\nThis project will be performed with the Norwegian company DNV GL which is interested in quality assurance of marine detection systems, and will also be related to the marine multi-sensro simulator project currently pursued at NTNU.\nStudents who are interested in this project are advised to address Prof. Rudolf Mester at IDI for more details.

By the term 3D-to-2D Face Recognition (3D-2D FR) we refer to the procedure of face recognition using as input a typical 2D facial image query (or a sequence of 2D facial images of the same identity) against a dataset containing 3D facial models (i.e., facial meshes or point clouds).\u00a0. To the best of our knowledge, most of the 3D-2D FR state-of-the-art methods do not use deep learning procedures [1,2]. Thus, as a proposed approach, classical deep learning networks [3], able to extract meaningful features from sequences of 2D face images, as well as modern geometric deep networks [4], able to extract meaningful features from 3D facial models, could be combined, using appropriate loss functions [6], in the form of the so-called Siamese Networks [5].. The training of such a network could be performed by using synthetic data to be generated by the FaceGen [7] tool that is available at the Visual Computing Lab.   ======================.

The focus of the thesis is to use artificial intelligence (AI) and multimodal data (MMD) to understand and support children\u2019s learning experiences through a carefully designed dashboard and data driven feedback mechanisms. MMD is derived from eyetracker, wrist band, and motion sensor (i.e., skeletal tracking). The dashboard provides the educational facilitator (i.e., instructor or parent) with a real-time visualisation of the learners cognitive, affective and physiological state based on the collected MMD. AI components will produce feedback mechanisms, which may be delivered directly to the learner, or to their educational facilitator.  Thesis Description. In a first step, the student needs to review the literature and familiarize themself with multimodal dashboard system. Then, the candidate will conceptualise and implement AI components to drive feedback mechanisms which support the learner during learning activities (directly or via their educational facilitator). Afterwards, the candidate will conduct a user study to empirically test the proposed AI components. Finally, the candidate will analyse the collected data and write up their thesis.  Requirements. The ideal candidate will have a background in AI, user experience and interface design. Front-end programming skills (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) and an interest in hands-on development (Python) and. experimentation is also a requirement.   Programming skills: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

To facilitate a correct device deployment the relationship between the anatomy and the position of the instruments has to be known and presented to the surgeon. The position of the instruments and the geometry of the vascular tree is best visualized on Xray images, with a wide field of view, however the resulting images are 2D projections of the 3D world for a given a position of the X-ray source. On the other hand the heart\u2019s anatomy is very well depicted using ultrasound images (e.g. 3D transesophageal ultrasound - TEE), however these images have a much smaller field of view due to the positioning of the TEE probe with regards to the heart. Therefore, tools that can automatically identify the position and orientation of the ultrasound probe and cathethers in X-ray images as well as automatic localization of anatomic structures of interest is highly desirable. Today most of these tasks are solved manually or semi-automatically, however automating them would improve the accuracy and also reduce the amount of time the interventionalists spend on aligning the images. We propose three topics for master theses all related to interventional applications of ultrasound imaging. They are:. - AI for ultrasound probe detection in X-ray images, the task will be to identify the location of the ultrasound probe but also its pose  - AI for catheter detection in the ultrasound volume and highlight of it in the image. The goal is to automatically detect catheter, delivery device and artificial devices (like MitraClip or artificial valves). Those objects give somewhat different echo signals but not always very clear nor complete. The task will be to detect automatically such objects within 3D ultrasound datasets. - AI for aortic valve detection in mitral trans esophageal acquisitions of the heart. Previous work supervised by Gabriel Kiss have been focusing on automatically detecting the mitral valve in 3D ultrasound data. This project aims at also detecting the aortic valve. The ultimate goal is automatic detection of anatomical structures running very fast (real-time if possible), so that the 3D data could automatic be presented in a way that makes sense to the physician, by rotating, cropping the 3D data based on the information detected in the images.

Discrimination/(Un)fairness can be investigated either between groups (e.g., female versus male, Black Americans versus White Americans etc) or between two individuals. This project is about individual fairness which has less been focussed in the AI-fairness field so far.

The instruction cache found in modern processors, in contrast, are only few tens of kilobytes. Given the mismatch between instruction footprint size and instruction cache capacity, it is paramount to make the optimal use of the limited instruction cache capacity. This project will take a step in that direction by first analysing how well cloud application use instruction caches. It will include analysis of the reuse rate of instruction cache blocks and fraction of instructions accessed/not-accessed within a block before the block is evicted, among other things.

The s-CG\u2019s performance on NVIDIA GPUs implemented in CUDA has shown to be  250-380% faster  than  standard CG for a range of sparse matrices arising in engineering model problems on older hardware. This project will focus on: (I) Implementing\u00a0 in CUDA the Communication Avoiding (CA) s-CG (s=1) (i.e. the  Chronopoulos\u2013Gear PCG) algorithm and the standard PCG algorithm on GPUs on a modern HPCS. (II) testing these algorithms using sparse linear systems from the library collection of sparse matrices of professor Tim Davies ( Univ of Texas A&M) Suite sparse matrix collection  https://sparse.tamu.edu/ The chosen student will work with both Prof. Anne Elster and Prof. Antony Chronopulous, originator of the s-CG.\u00a0 Futher reading and background: Communication Avoiding (CA) algorithms in numerical linear algebra  have been  proposed by J. Demmel (Univ. California,  Berkeley) and his co-authors (see e.g. [1] and refs therein) . The CA algorithms  are much more scalable than standard  linear algebra algorithms on exascale HPC systems (HPCS) and also on GPUs.  The Conjugate Gradient method is a widely used method for approximating the solution of sparse linear systems. The s-step Conjugate Gradient (CG) (s-CG)  (with s>1, e.g.  s =5) s-CG is a CA iterative algorithm proposed and programmed in the past ([2-3]). This s-CG algorithm has been shown to be scalable on modern  HPCS. Also, s-CG  has been incorporated in software for (CFD) engineering simulations   e.g.  Parallel Ocean Program (POP), simulation software for the earth\u2019s  global ocean circulation model  at Los Alamos National Laboratory, uses s-CG as its core HPC sparse linear solver (see [4]) . Another outstanding examples of  software using the  s-CG, as the best HPC iterative solver, is the Community Ice Sheet Simulator (CISM-2) for earth\u2019s glaciers ice sheet simulation [5]. Text quoted from [5]: \u201cThe matrices and RHS vectors are passed to either a \u201cstandard\u201d PCG solver (Shewchuk, 1994) or a Chronopoulos\u2013Gear PCG solver (Chronopoulos, 1986; Chronopoulos and Gear, 1989). The PCG algorithm includes two dot products (each requiring a global sum), one matrix\u2013vector product, and one preconditioning step per iteration. For small problems, the dominant computational cost is the matrix\u2013vector product. For large problems, however, the global sums become increasingly expensive. In this case, the Chronopoulos\u2013Gear solver is more efficient than the standard solver, because it rearranges operations such that both global sums are done with a single MPI call.\u201d References:.

Computer vision for robots, self-driving cars, and also for driver assistance very often assumes very good visibility conditions -- the area is very much dominated by the nice weather conditions that are found when driving e.g. in the Silicon Valley environment. However, autonomous driving or visual driver assistance in the Nordic Countries needs to deal very often with bad weather conditions: rain or snow, thus wet or snow-covered road surfaces, making vision conditions even worse by the froth or spray caused by vehicles in front of the own one. This project deals with the exploration what the combination of machine learning and classicial computer vision methods can do in order to detect other vehicles in a distance, road markings, side barriers, and other obstacles as early and as robustly as possible. One way often being taken in the (sparse) literature about this important topic is to try to improve the quality of the incoming image/video material and subsequently employ 'off-the-shelf' / textbook computer vision algorithms. We do not think that this is the best way to proceed; rather than that, the methods of detecting objects (e.g. in spray, snow, or haze) and the methods for estimating distances and the 3D structure of the environment should consider the afflicted image acquisition process from the very start, and design new algorithms that can cope with the image degradations either by modeling them explicitly (classical approach), or by training learning-based approaches. The topic of visual environment perception and situation assessment under bad visibility conditions is of course not only of interest in conjunction with cars and road traffic, but equally also for marine applications. The project can build on an existing database of 'bad weather driving'. If the student(s) working on this project are interested, they can be brought into contact with one of the leading industrial research laboratories for driver assistance and autonomous driving, based in Germany.

CNN-based object tracking is another area of our interest.  The annual Visual Object Tracking (VOT) challenge is a good reference to follow the state-of-the-art results. . Our unique challenge is that the cracks often have irregular shapes such as very thin lines and follow arbitrary directions. The object detection models which output horizontal bounding boxes may not yield satisfied detection results. The object detection model which outputs oriented bounding boxes might provide better detection results (i.e., tightly bound the actual cracks). . Since VOT 2015, rotated bounding box annotations are used by the VOT committee to provide highly accurate ground truth values for comparing results. That means the winners of VOT should have developed the corresponding models/solutions to output rotated bounding boxes.      . The first research question is to investigate whether existing VOT models/solutions can be used to detect cracks in ship survey images? . However, the CNN based object tracking models require a large amount of training data to achieve a good performance level,. and so far, the number of available training images is in the order. of several thousands of images, and it is hard to go beyond that by orders of magnitude, as one could wish..

Once the plastic reaches the oceans, it is broken down into smaller particles(micro-plastic) by being exposed to ultra violet (UV) radiation and mechanical abrasion from wave actions [1].The quantity of plastic waste floating at the ocean surface in 2013 was estimated to be approximately 269,000 tonnes (small macro- to micro-plastic), this estimate does not include plastic in-depth or at the seafloor). The plastic debris can affect the wildlife in multiple ways, such as entanglement- entrapping, encircling, or constricting,ingestion- accidental ingestion or ingestion of prey containing plastic, and interaction- being in contact with plastic debris [1].It is therefore important to be able to detect and collect the plastic waste in nature,before it reaches the oceans. Once plastic waste has reaches a micro-stadium, it is near impossible to collect it and remove it from the water. An analysis on deep sea locations(range from 1176 to 4843m) showed that there was an average abundance of 1 micro-plastic per 25cm3(particle sizes ranging from 75 to 161\u03bcm) [2] The AI-task will support the observation and monitoring of plastic items\u200b at consumer side, such as cities, beaches..... We will monitor the geographic distribution of different types of plastic items in these areas. The data will be gathered by citizens in form of taking photos of plastic objects. The photos will be taken using an application on smart phones. The application will have an artificial intelligence (deep learning) algorithm specially tailored for recognition of the material type of the plastic in the photos. The combined information about the geographic distribution, plastic type, and the object type (e.g., bottle, bag) pertinent to plastic debris will be collected in a database which in turn will be statistically analyzed and visualized. The smart application will serve as a tool for empowering citizen science and will contribute to the increase of the awareness and collaboration of citizens towards mitigation of plastic pollution problem.

This topic combines modern method of video processing, in particular scene tracking an camera motion estimation with detection methods which today most often come from the domain of machine learning. The approach to the crack detection problem proposed here exploits that idea that cracks typically do not only have a two-dimensional appearance (for instance, like a line drawn on the material), but also have a three-dimensional structure, often a very tiny gap in the surface. It can be expected that a moving camera, in particular when it carries its own illumination, will show the crack not only by its two-dimensional appearance, but also by the change of this appearance, caused by illumination and image acquisition from different viewpoints.. In order to exploit this effect, a set of image frames from the video stream has to \u2018motion-compensated\u2019, that is: the position and orientation of a crack candidate is stabilized in the visual field for a short while, say, for about 3 seconds or 10-100 image frames. Here, temporal subsampling, that is: taking only each n-th frame may be permitted. In the stabilized image subsequence, it is expected that the crack varies in appearance in a typical way which is related to the change of illumination.. The motion-compensated image subsequence is then fed into a detection unit which does not work on a single RGB image, but on a stack of such images. A deep network trained on true (or synthetic) crack images with a CNN in the front end is a highly promising candidate for the detector architecture. Also for this task it will be a challenge to come up with training methods that allow to train the network with a limited set of training images.. A potential side aspect of this task which might turn out to be of key importance to the feasibility of the solution is the attempt to generated synthetic, but still realistic crack images, e.g. by combining real crack images which are artificially augmented by a hallucinated 3D surface structure and \u2018re-illuminated\u2019 using advanced computer graphics methods. This approach is optional, but might develop into a rewarding endeavour for students which are also interest in image rendering.

RE of software is applied where the original source code for a program is missing, proprietary, or otherwise unavailable. Motivation for RE ranges from extending support of legacy software to discovery of security vulnerabilities to creating open source alternatives to proprietary software. RE usually targets binary programs with a known instruction set architecture (ISA) and executable format. The RE process proceeds by disassembling the binary into assembly code, and where possible decompiling the assembly to yield high-level source code (for example, C source code). However, in many cases the ISA is either undocumented, unknown, or unavailable. In addition, malware has been shown to use custom virtual machines to avoid detection. Such cases prove extremely time intensive for the reverse engineer. ISA features such as word size, instruction format, register size, and number of physical registers are a prerequisite to disassembly.

It uses a so-called graph-based SLAM approach, building on available libraries for graph-based optimiization, in particular the iSAM2 library by Kaess, Dellaert et al. In the new approach, the individual components of the existing system will be re-inspected in depth, in particular in the area of data association. This term denotes the process of associating each detected landmark (here: the LiDaR-detected cones) at time instant N with the correctly corresponding landmark at time instant N+1. As the cones all look the same, and as the cone detector will sometimes produce errors (cones missed, or wrong cones hallucinated), this problem is difficult, and it is of utmost importance to make this association right, as even few undetected 'outliers' in the measurements / detection result can lead to catastrophic consequences in the egomotion estimation and map building. The approaches to be investigated in the new version of the SLAM algorithm focus on this data association process. They will explicitly use a dynamic model of the car motion and extensive statistical modeling of the landmark detector reliability as well as statistical modeling of all other sources of error in the data processing process, as far as the tolerable computational effort allows for this. It is also desired that the data association process is implemented using criteria for self-supervision. The possibiliy of multi-hypothesis operation, and using backtracking and 'warm restart' in case of (rare) failures of the overall dynamic state estimation process should be investigated. Optionally, it can be investigated if and where usage of modern machine learning methods may contribute to a safe and solid solution to the dynamic state estimation process. The project requires experience in statistical data analysis, or the willingness to acquire corresponding background knowledge in the preparatory phase, interest or experience in real time programming, and of course some enthusiasm towards the idea of building an 'intelligent car'.

The techniques that exploit memory level parallelism (MLP) try to mitigate the bottleneck by hiding the latency of later requests, at least partially, under the shadow of earlier requests. Runahead execution [1] is a powerful technique to exploit memory level parallelism in out-of-order cores. It checkpoints the current core state when the ROB\u00a0is full and stalled, flushes the ROB (and other required structures), and start to fetch and execute instructions speculatively.

Typical examples of such huge graphs are genomic sequences and their associated gene expression graphs, web graph and its related SNS data, social networks like Facebook and Twitter, chemical networks, geographical data sets, VLSI graphs, and many more. Traditional data structures do not scale well enough to handle such large graphs, and therefore we need to design new data structures to handle them. Graph compression: The key observation which enables us to compress such large graphs is the fact that many big data sets have large amount of redundancy. For example, in the Webgraph, many nodes (webpages) are copies of others; in global positioning system (GPS), GPS position data change continuously, which can be compressed using differential encoding; and in genomics, although different individuals have different genomes, the individual genomes have very highly similarity. Therefore, we can compress such data by identifying the similar parts, and reducing/removing the redundancy. Apart from storing the data in compressed form, we also need to access and search the data efficiently. Conventional data structures are not designed to handle compressed data and they may not manipulate such large graphs well because the size of the data structures exceeds the limit of memory usage, or searching time increases due to their size. To handle these problems, researchers have worked on developing compressed data structures. Such data structures are also called compact or succinct data structures. One of the aims is to design such data structures for a variety of graph classes which appear in theory and in real life situations. Graph indexing: A wide range of problems have been studied under the area of graph indexing, especially in the context of graph databases [SG2013]. For our purposes, graph indexing refers to the problem of preprocessing a given graph to construct an index that enables answering a particular type of queries on the graph efficiently.

More often than not, the analyses deal with the issue by analysing only a single dataset at time, as the biases are difficult to accurately describe. Ironically, combining datasets with different biases can be used to identify and eliminate the biases, and keep only the genuine biological variation. The goal of this project is creating a machine-learning algorithm to automatically identify consistent expression profiles in biological data, and biases associated to individual experiment designs. The student will learn how to apply machine learning to real-world data. The problem may be approached both as designing an estimator or creating a classifier. The expression profiles can be perceived as signals at a higher abstraction level, and a thorough understanding of the biology behind is not necessary. Nevertheless, basic understanding of the experimental designs will be required to adequately massage the data for the machine-learning model. The focus is mainly on RNA expression data, and should include microarray and RNA-seq data. Relevant experimental designs to include in the work are time-series experiments (measurements at time-intervals following introduction of/release from a treatment) and data comparing two experimental conditions. An example of the former might be measuring expression throughout cell-cycle upon releasing the cell culture from a treatment blocking the cell culture to progress past a certain point in the cell cycle.

When studying eukaryotic cell cycle, the most common approach involves synchronizing a cell culture. In this method, the cells, grown in a medium, are prevented to progress through the cell cycle past a certain phase, usually through use of a chemical agent. The block is then released, and the cells are allowed to progress through the cell cycle. We can assign each cell a phase angle \u03b1, representing its progress in the cell cycle. Then, we can describe the cell-cycle phase distribution of a culture. Moreover, for cell-cycle related genes, we may represent their expression as a function of \u03b1. An unsynchronized culture will then attain an equilibrium distribution, whereas a synchronized culture starts with a narrow phase distribution, which then evolves in time upon release of the block, converging to the said equilibrium distribution. In this project, the student should create a model that captures the evolution of cell-cycle phase distribution in time, upon synchronizing cells of different types, using different synchronization methods. Specifically, certain synchronization methods cause initially slower, or vice versa faster, cell cycle. Moreover, the cells may not behave completely alike to one another, but may rather feature several distinct populations. A model for this stratification might take as a starting point data from single cell sequencing. Besides the advancements for fundamental research, such a model should prove useful in deconvolving and interpolating expression profiles from different experiments, thereby making the data comparable.

Instruction scheduling is the most complex and power intensive operation in modern out-of-order (OoO) cores accounting for up to 40% of core power consumption[1]. The following projects, leading to subsequent theses, aim to design power-efficient instruction scheduling mechanisms for OoO cores: 1)\u00a0Criticality aware instruction scheduling: Current instruction scheduling mechanisms prioritize critical instructions over the non-critical ones; nonetheless, they treat all critical instructions equally[2]. However, not all critical instructions contribute equally to the performance. This project will explore quantifying the criticality of critical instructions to prioritize allocation of limited number of power hungry resources. It will explore different criticality metrices and their trade-offs. 2) Instruction Scheduling in SMT\u00a0cores: Simultaneous multi-threaded (SMT) processors share core resources among multiple threads and hence put even more pressure on instruction scheduling. Our recent work [3] has shown that the complexity of instruction scheduling can be significantly reduced by exploiting instruction characteristics such as criticality and readiness. Though this work is limited only to single threaded cores. This project will build on this work and explore mechanisms to reduce instruction scheduling complexity in SMT out-of-order cores. The availability of multiple threads in SMT cores provides opportunities to further reduce the instruction scheduling complexity.

The proposed approach is a statistical one: the ultimate goal is to provide at the output of a deep network not only the result (a discrete class, or a real number value), but also statistically calibrated confidence information. Basically, this amounts to not only providing result values, but a probability distribution about the range of possible output values. I propose to firstly compile the latest literature on this topic, often associated with the term \"Bayesian Neural Networks\", but taking also into consideration the recent work on 'out of distribution' detection, that is: the detection of the cases where the input data is outside of the range of input data that has been covered by the training data set. As this domain is a part of a very high dimensional space, this task is significantly more difficult than it seems on the first look. After the state of the art has been analyzed and systematically categorized, the project should aim at one or two exemplary implementations of the most promising approaches; in the ideal case, an own novel approach should be proposed and evaluated (this is optional).

The main idea is that ego-motion of a robot can be learned from the visual input in combination with data from an inertial measurement uni (IMU) which is able to sense translational acceleration and rotational velocity. This is (hypothetically) the same way how humans and animals learn to perceive their motion, by combining data from visual input and the inner ear (sense of balance). In the project, a suitable camera with build-in IMU (Intel Realsense) shall be used to first collect extensive data (video and IMU recordings), and then in step 2 design an architecture that learns to derive the desired information (translation and rotation of the camera) from that data. We think of really huge data sets in the order of magnitude of 1 Terabyte as the relation to be learned is more complex as this simplified project description can convey. One important principle to be followed in this project is that we search for an architecture which is as sparse as possible while being still in the position to solve the given problem reliably. This means, it is _not_ intended to \"simply\" try a very deep architecture and solve the problem by computational overkill. The basis for this \"sparse\" and efficient solution is that quite a lot is known about motion perception in biological systems and in computer vision. The front end of the envisaged structure is a CNN with a spatio-temporal (that is: 3dimensional) input layer, 1 time dimension and 2 spatial dimensions. In other words, the primary information processing layer does not only work on 2 images (as in many approaches), but on a stack of N images, N >>2. This refers to the fact that the projection of most motions onto the retina (or camera image plane) is mostly a smooth curve; things do not oscillate wildly when we regard them, but they move (mostly) smoothly across the image plane. The output of this CNN is a (coarse) estimate of the so called \"optical flow fleld\", but in contrast to most conventional schemes, the output is not (only) a 2D motion vector, but comes in terms of a vector of latent variables that describe the local motion in a richer, more informative way. This first layer will be tranined essentially like an auto-encoder network. During the training process, it will be investigated whether is is useful to include the measurements from the IMU into the loss function. This first \u00a0layer with a coarse subsampling of the \"extended optical flow\" field is subsequently fed into a second network which,given the already trained first CNN layer is trained to provide, together with the inertial measurement unit, the final ego-motion data, that is: the translational and rotational motion of the camera. This project is well suited for a student (or two students) who do not only have some initial knowledge about visual computing (e.g. from\u00a0TDT4195 - Visual Computing Fundamentals) and deep learning (e.g.\u00a0TDT4265 Computer Vision and Deep Learning) --- such knowledge is essential ---, but are also interested in thorough mathematical analysis and modeling of the regarded problem, and are interested in a _structured_ solution architecture that reflects all the known facts about the problem. So the ability and the willingness to regard the problem also from the mathematical and statistical side is a requirement. In the ideal case, the student(s) will be supported to report about their results not only in a thesis, but also in a conference paper. This is an option, but not a stringent requirement.

They usually require large sets of labeled training data. In this project, we address the problem of detecting objects in images / video by building up or learning _structured_ object models, that is: a composition of parts that make up the particular class of objects. Most objects of interests (human beings, animals, cars, buildings, ...) can be described as being built up by such parts. The research question to be addressed is whether from first training a conventional deep learning-based object detector, and subsequently analyzing the found and parameterized network, these parts can be found automatically, or possibly semi-automatically. If such a parts structure has been found, the approach to be followed is to itentify part detectors speciallized on these parts, and build up a structured 'decision system' that processes the results of the part detectors, the geometrical locations of the detected parts, the confidence level of the individual detections, and the relations between these parts. The hypothesis to be followed by this approach is that a statisitically optimum object detector can be built from combining the expressive power of deep neetworks in the part detectors, and the solid mathematical basis of making decisions based on the fusion of different object cues (location, geometrical relation, individual detection confidence). This architecture is supposed to have also the advantage of being 'explainable by construction', a requirement very often found these days for any serious application of machine learning in safety-critical environments.

In my world there is a difference between the concepts of learning and training. Learning is the concept of the brain. The brain changes it structure and functionality to adapt to the environment (may say learn to handle a task/problem). The underlying processes of learning are mostly unknown. Even if the processes of learning are unknown, there are some concepts at a higher abstraction level that are known, e.g. local communication, local information, local control vast parallelist and emergence. The concept of Artificial Neural Networks is training. Training uses some form of global control. Training has global information available. Training is (mostly) sequential. ANN is currently very successful solving problems that are hard to solve using traditional programming methods. One of the costs of the success is power. A supercomputer (like the one at NTNU) uses MW of power. Training is a time-consuming process, as such, training cost energy, time * power, training for a day cost can be 24 hours * 1 MW = 24 MWh. One observable property of the brain is power, the brain uses approx. 40W. ANNs uses mostly floating-point data, e.g. 64 bit. The brain uses pulses and analogue values. In resent research it has been shown that when trained an ANN's accuracy can be reduced, e.g. from 64 bit float down to far less precision, even down to binary (Binarized Neural Network). Such an reduction can make a system extremely much more energy efficient. However, such an reduction is done from a trained network. The training was executed at a high precision level. Binarized Neural Network In this project the goal is to get insight in the relationship between high precision and low precision networks by exploring the search landscape of high accuracy network versus low accuracy(binary) network.

Which part of the vSLAM development is determined to be the focus area of the student project is subject to negotiation; the intention is to let the students experiment with novel approaches proposed in the recent literature, some of them focusing on geometric models and statistical estimation theory, others on machine learning. So we are able to adapt the topic largely to the background knowledge the student(s) already have, and their interest into different relevant research fields, such as e.g. state estimation, optimization, object detection and tracking, machine learning and deep learning. Potential focus topics:.  * Robust keypoint tracking in the presence of underwater image degradation. * Dynamic Model based prediction and correcting in keypoint and object tracking in underwater conditions. * Pose graph and state sequence optimization for underwater visual SLAM. * Integration of IMU measurements in underwater visual SLAM. * Machine Learning for depth estimation, flow field estimation, and visual clutter detection  Potential focus topics:      Literature:  Literature D.

Each day Tr\u00f8nderEnergi has to make production bids, declaring what amounts of power will be produced at an hourly basis for the next day. Such bids are collected from all power producers, and a market-price and the corresponding amount Tr\u00f8nderEnergi will have to produce is thereby found. If for some reason Tr\u00f8nderEnergi fails to produce the agreed amount, there are financial consequences (through having to buy power from others at a higher price in the so-called balancing-market). Therefore, making optimal advance bids taking uncertainty of production (e.g., due to problems in a production unit or lack of wind to produce wind energy) into account is a very crucial part of Tr\u00f8nderEnergi\u2019s business. . . Problem description. Since the production-bidding is a crucial part of Tr\u00f8nderEnergi\u2019s core business, there is a significant in-house competence in the area.

Wind-power production facilities are complex systems, with rotating parts that sometimes break and therefore forces halts in production. To avoid unforeseen lost production, and to run the power production as efficiently as possible, Tr\u00f8nderEnergi make preventive maintenance plans based on data for typical life-length of equipment and rules of thumb. The AI department at Tr\u00f8nderEnergi is currently developing a \u201cblack box\u201d monitoring system that will incorporate real-time measurements of working conditions (e.g., temperature, weather, etc). The goal is to avoid unplanned shut-downs through maintenance plans that fix or replace deteriorated parts at opportune times (e.g., when the production is low due to lack of wind).\n\nProblem description\nThe black-box system for maintenance planning is central in Tr\u00f8nderEnergi\u2019s operation of the wind-mill parks. It will be continuously confronted with a diverse set of end-users: Technicians wanting to know what parts to repair at what time.

We are the largest medical laboratory in Norway and our main office is located at Furuset, Oslo. Our main objective is to provide our clients, mainly general practitioners in the primary healthcare and their patients, with fast and accurate analysis of medical tests along with expert advice and interpretation. F\u00fcrst employs some 400 people, most of whom are bioengineers and 17 medical doctors within the various laboratory disciplines. Our IT-Department consists of about 30 software and computer engineers and is responsible for developing the client facing requisitioning software and the laboratory information system. The thesis will be carried out within the Analytics unit in the IT Department under the supervision and guidance of our two senior data scientists, both of whom have extensive experience in the industry and academia. Problem description Problem description Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods have the potential to improve healthcare and enhance medical knowledge by empowering clinicians and practitioners with new and useful insights that are otherwise unavailable.. A major obstacle to harnessing this potential is the unavailability of high-quality data. National and EU regulations as well as legitimate privacy concerns hamper the direct use of electronic health records and clinical trial results for research and explorative purposes. Approaches based on data anonymization are usually applied to overcome this problem and preserve data privacy. However, these strategies are often based on techniques which take out a substantial share of data and/or data features, resulting in an overall loss of potentially valuable information. Furthermore, real data \u2013 especially in a medical/healthcare context \u2013 suffer from (or are characterised by) unavoidable flaws such as small dataset sizes, class imbalance, noise, all of which complicates and slows down the implementation and testing of ML models.. Synthetic data generation (SDG) represents the ideal solution to this conundrum. Broadly speaking the term synthetic data refers to the generation of artificial data which exhibit the same statistical properties and underlying structures of an original dataset. The generation of reliable synthetic data could help ML practitioners in the healthcare sector to quickly test data analytics and ML strategies, while preserving data privacy without relying on methods vulnerable to waste of useful data. Moreover, synthetic data, stripped of sensitive and private information, can be openly published and shared, thus facilitating a virtuous circle of research and dissemination.   Thesis description Thesis description The focus of this master thesis project is the selection and implementation of ML/DL algorithms for the generation of high-quality synthetic patient records based on real patient records collected and stored by. F\u00fcrst. Electronic patient records often include multiple biomarkers, and thus the generated synthetic data should reproduce the statistical properties of high-dimensional and complex distributions, which might also vary in time in case of patient records tracking the evolution of a particular biomarker over time. This is a challenging and fascinating scientific question, which can be tackled with cutting edge deep learning methods. We propose to explore a framework based on (the application of) generative adversarial networks. (GAN), which have been successfully used in other contexts including synthetic generation of images.. The outline of the project is the following:    Literature review on the state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning methods for SDR.. Selection and implementation of the most relevant method(s) for the generation of synthetic\u00a0patient records, in collaboration with the Analytics unit at F\u00fcrst.. Application and evaluation of the selected method(s) using real patient records data. Initially, static\u00a0data will be considered. Then, depending on the progress achieved, time-series patient data will also\u00a0be examined..

Data Data The data will be structured, numerical biochemical data (blood values). Exactly which biomarkers should be used in this thesis is yet to be determined, but it will easily be in the millions of rows, going back decades. The data will be de-identified and minimally preprocessed, but due to the sensitivity of the data and lack of agreed upon strategies for ensured anonymisation, certain features should only be accessed and manipulated in F\u00fcrst internal servers. Only the synthetic data and the models created during the work in this thesis should be made publicly available. We will also ask that a confidentiality agreement be signed as part of our internal data protection and privacy measures. Challenges. While there are no specific financial or business-related concerns to sharing data, we must always ensure that the data is properly anonymised and protected and that we are always operating within GDPR and Norwegian laws. As such, prior to starting the thesis work, F\u00fcrst will seek approval for the project to the Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REC) and perform a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). Aside from the practical challenges and formalities, there are also some interesting issues related to generating synthetic data of too high a quality. Literature suggests that there is a point where the data generation might become too good and too close to the original data leading to potential problems with respect to the re-identification of the original patient records.

However, in order to be able, evaluate, choose and design the right equipment for the riders, accurate race predictions are needed.. While some factors can be estimated with physical models (gravity, power production, air resistance to mention a few), some other factors are complex to estimate and they are often rider dependent (braking, ability to ride in the curves) or weather dependent (temperature, humidity, weather) or even dependent on the physiological shape of the rider (peak training, end season, etc.).. In particular, one of the models currently developed produces good results in the straight and flat parts of the course but fails to estimate the rider\u2019s velocity in the downhill parts.   While the trends are well captured, further work is needed in order to correctly predict the riders performances with the ultimate goal of delivering rider-tuned model. With Team INEOS being always in the forefront when gathering marginal gains, the attention towards machine learning approaches which would lead towards rider-specific time trial simulators is very high. Main tasks. The present work will then be targeted towards a product that can better estimate the performances of each rider, learning from simulated time trials and training data gathered by the athletes during the training season and from time trials executed during races.. The project will consist of two phases:. Develop a fully data driven simulator and compare it with the deterministic model currently used by the team. Develop a hybrid model where the predictions of the deterministic model currently used by the team are improved by a data-driven add-on. Team INEOS will have the provide the anonymized data needed for the development of the model and will follow the development having an active role.

Refinitiv Research&Forecast With the extreme increase in renewables in Europe it is becoming increasingly important to identify in advance possible weather conditions which might lead to wind power curtailment. Curtailment of power is a common phenomenon in wind farms. It simply means that the wind turbine is made to operate at a capacity lower than it should at a certain wind speed. This can be forced for safety reasons by the plant owners, or for grid congestion reasons by the system operators. Developing algorithms for anticipating such curtailment is of crucial importance both for the system operators and for the traders, since it will lead to more precise wind power forecasts, and as a consequence to better decisions.

Most commonly, the anomalies to be detected do not come from single counters but from systems recording several counters, that is, generating multivariate time series. The difficulty in individuating anomalies in multivariate time series arises from the fact that the contexts and correlations between the different features and time windows have to be taken into account and examined. Baseline probabilistic models (such as Gaussian mixture models) are used today, but they are unable to detect the interesting anomalous behaviour that occurs. Moreover, static non data-driven thresholds are used to infer whether a signal is abnormal or not, completely ignoring the context and traffic patterns. Problem description  Thesis description. There are two main types of anomalies that are desirable to detect: 1) point anomalies and 2) trend anomalies. The latter, corresponding to failures in the Network, are especially hard to recognise, as they do not differ much from the \u201cnormal\u201d situation, so one has to leverage on the correlations between the time series components and also use the topological information on the location of the base stations, in order to discover them. In this thesis, the student(s) will explore the capabilities of Deep models such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and/or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for the task of anomaly detection. In particular the student(s) will:. - Explore the state of the art in use of Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection for both the univariate and the multivariate case. - Define the limitations of the current SoTA methods. - Implement a set of strong baselines. - Propose one++ GNN/GAN based solution for Anomaly Detection on Telco data, leveraging on the correlations between the multivariate time series components and spatial correlations between the neighbouring base stations.

Most of the 3D FER state-of-the-art methods extract hand-crafted features [1-5], which could be considered as a digital signature of the face, and use them in order to compare different 3D faces through trained classifiers or similarity functions [6]. . The rise of deep learning networks tends to replace the hand-crafted features with features automatically extracted by the deep networks. Nonetheless, deep networks require large training datasets in order to converge and produce reliable results.. Up until recently, deep networks could not be sufficiently implemented in the case of 3D FER for two reasons: 1) lack of existence of large labelled 3D face datasets for training and 2) deep networks could not consume 3D data (3D meshes, point clouds etc.) as input.. The 1st issue has been solved with the improvement of the 3D data acquisition hardware. More and more 3D face datasets are produced [7-9], along with software capable of producing synthetic 3D face models [10], which can further augment the real data within a deep training process.. For resolving the 2nd issue, initially, the methodologies converted the actual 3D data into a 2D modality like depth images or geometry images [11, 12]. Thus making the data compatible with the existing deep networks. This is expected to change in the near future, due to the newest machine learning trend, the so-called Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) [13,14]. GDL introduces deep networks that can be fed with 3D meshes, point clouds and graphs. Thus, GDL models are very interesting to be studied in order to find out whether they can achieve a performance boost in terms of 3D FER evaluation measures, as they have already done in other computer vision applications.. Additionally, and depending on the progress, more applications of the system will be examined i.e. 3D Facial Expressions Recognition or 3D Facial Micro-expressions Detection.      ======================.

When building object detectors for marine applications, it is particularly important to have training sets which do not only contain a sufficient number of relevant object classes (ships, piers, buoys, ...), but also show the different variations in lighting conditions, and weather conditions (fog, rain, snow, ...). As it is difficult, if practically possible at all, to record a sufficient number of such images or videos for training object detector networks, this project aims at artificially generating these variations of image conditions, in particular different illumination and strongly different weather conditions.\nImage augmentation is a well-known technique for synthetically expanding limited or imbalanced training datasets used in computer vision tasks to improve generalization performance and to avoid overfitting. Likewise, augmentations can be used for testing network generalization performance, by imposing varying augmentations, e.g. two-dimensional augmentations such as shifts, rotations, etc., as well as natural phenomena, e.g. snow, fog, lighting conditions, etc., or even adding synthetic objects to the scene. The former is straightforward using simple transformations in two dimensions, whereas the latter should imitate realistic, and highly stochastic, scenarios that in reality depends on the depth information of the scene. Nonetheless, this is often done by basic image manipulations imposed uniformly over the whole scene without considering depth information and may result in unrealistic augmentations not representing reality and could possibly produce erroneous testing performance. As an example, fog or rain may be observed only at a certain distance and/or area and affects only specific far-away objects, rather than all objects in the scene. The proposed research topic is therefore to investigate techniques for extracting depth information from images or video and taking advantage of this information to apply augmentations of natural phenomena in 3-Dimensions.\nFor the extraction of this 3D information, one can use recent methods of single image depth estimation by deep neural networks, or \"motion stereo\" from a moving camera (in case of video sequences). Both approaches can also be combined.\nTherefore, the first partial goal of this project is to explore methods for depth estimation for given training images or videos.\nThe second goal is to use the extracted estimate of the depth structure to simulate the desired weather and illumination situation, such as fog, rain, or snow. Again, this can be done by \"classical\" physics-based computer graphics modeling, and/or by suitably trained deeep neural networks.\nAnother important aspect is to benchmark 2D and 3D synthetic augmentations against images containing actual natural phenomena\u2019s, i.e. network performance on synthetic scenes against true scenes.\nThis project will be performed with the Norwegian company DNV GL which is interested in quality assurance of marine detection systems, and will also be related to the marine multi-sensro simulator project currently pursued at NTNU.\nStudents who are interested in this project are advised to address Prof. Rudolf Mester at IDI for more details.

To the best of our knowledge, most of the 3D-2D FR state-of-the-art methods do not use deep learning procedures [1,2]. Thus, as a proposed approach, classical deep learning networks [3], able to extract meaningful features from sequences of 2D face images, as well as modern geometric deep networks [4], able to extract meaningful features from 3D facial models, could be combined, using appropriate loss functions [6], in the form of the so-called Siamese Networks [5]..

Currently, DNV GL Group Technology and Research is actively developing a conceptual autonomous ship called ReVolt. ReVolt is dedicated as a platform for exploring and experimenting how to integrate novel technologies and equipment into autonomous ships to achieve the required level of ocean autonomy. \nThe most crucial and novel part of ReVolt is the navigation system which integrates both matured and novel maritime technologies, various types of sensors and machine learning technologies to achieve different levels of ship navigation. It has been widely recognized that cyber-physical systems highly depending on various types of sensors and complex algorithms to operate are both vulnerable to physical harm and subjected to cyberattacks. Therefore, we need to fully assess the potential cyber risks to assure that ReVolt can safely operate and complete its missions. Based on the current implementation of Revolt, we have identified several tasks to be carried to help DNV GL understand the feasibility of potential cyberattacks against the navigation system of ReVolt. Consequently, such learning and experience will help DNV GL define new class rules for certifying autonomous ships and develop Verification & Validation (V&V) requirements for autonomous ships. As deep neural networks (DNNs)-based computer vision technologies have been widely used in autonomous cars to detect their surroundings, it is very promising to use similar technologies in the navigation system of autonomous ships. However, it has been proven that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the form of subtle perturbations to inputs. Such subtle perturbations in the images are often too small to be perceptible by human vision, yet they may lead the DNNs to output wrong results. . In this task, the candidate will firstly explore existing adversarial input attacks against DNN-based object recognition models. Secondly, the candidate will experiment how to successfully attack the obstacle detection implemented on ReVolt either in a lab environment (e.g., simulation environment) or field environment.

The focus of the thesis is to use artificial intelligence (AI) and multimodal data (MMD) to understand and support children\u2019s learning experiences through a carefully designed dashboard and data driven feedback mechanisms. MMD is derived from eyetracker, wrist band, and motion sensor (i.e., skeletal tracking). The dashboard provides the educational facilitator (i.e., instructor or parent) with a real-time visualisation of the learners cognitive, affective and physiological state based on the collected MMD. AI components will produce feedback mechanisms, which may be delivered directly to the learner, or to their educational facilitator.  Thesis Description.

To facilitate a correct device deployment the relationship between the anatomy and the position of the instruments has to be known and presented to the surgeon. The position of the instruments and the geometry of the vascular tree is best visualized on Xray images, with a wide field of view, however the resulting images are 2D projections of the 3D world for a given a position of the X-ray source. On the other hand the heart\u2019s anatomy is very well depicted using ultrasound images (e.g. 3D transesophageal ultrasound - TEE), however these images have a much smaller field of view due to the positioning of the TEE probe with regards to the heart. Therefore, tools that can automatically identify the position and orientation of the ultrasound probe and cathethers in X-ray images as well as automatic localization of anatomic structures of interest is highly desirable. Today most of these tasks are solved manually or semi-automatically, however automating them would improve the accuracy and also reduce the amount of time the interventionalists spend on aligning the images. We propose three topics for master theses all related to interventional applications of ultrasound imaging. They are:. - AI for ultrasound probe detection in X-ray images, the task will be to identify the location of the ultrasound probe but also its pose  - AI for catheter detection in the ultrasound volume and highlight of it in the image. The goal is to automatically detect catheter, delivery device and artificial devices (like MitraClip or artificial valves). Those objects give somewhat different echo signals but not always very clear nor complete. The task will be to detect automatically such objects within 3D ultrasound datasets. - AI for aortic valve detection in mitral trans esophageal acquisitions of the heart. Previous work supervised by Gabriel Kiss have been focusing on automatically detecting the mitral valve in 3D ultrasound data. This project aims at also detecting the aortic valve. The ultimate goal is automatic detection of anatomical structures running very fast (real-time if possible), so that the 3D data could automatic be presented in a way that makes sense to the physician, by rotating, cropping the 3D data based on the information detected in the images.

To find the optimal jacket design entails a minimization of the steel weight, while ensuring the structural integrity of the jacket as well as ensuring that it can be efficiently constructed. Kvaerner has made use of a genetic algorithm to optimise the jacket geometry, but while the algorithm itself is efficient, the third-party software used to evaluate the structures is more time consuming. This results in an interest of reducing the number of generations needed. Theoretical work includes: 1. Literature study of relevant methods used in structural design 2. Literature study of bio-inspired AI, and more generally stochastic optimization techniques, used in automated engineering 3. Literature study on methods used to avoid early convergence and how to handle costly fitness evaluation The starting point will be optimization via existing GA used by Kv\u00e6rner today. Calculating fitness is the main bottleneck today, so reducing the number of generations, reducing the population size, or other improved ways to handle the cost of fitness evaluation will be beneficial. To do so, the student group may, for example, study, implement, and test improvements in evolutionary algorithms, such as in crossover and mutation. Supporting mechanism will also be looked into. The group may also look into other options, such as avoiding the calculation of fitness every generation using the 3rd party program in use today.

It is an enabling technology with a wide range of applications. For example, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been an area which has contributed significantly to the general development of both AI and ML. In spite of impressive progress in recent years, conversational speech and colloquial dialect speech pose major problems for speech technology in general, and for the Norwegian language in particular. There are still significant application areas that require innovative solutions and breakthroughs in order to be fully realized.  Issues that must be resolved include both language technology in general and applications for the Norwegian language (and other resource-constrained languages). In fact, the importance of improving language technology, including speech recognition, in the handling of Norwegian has been highlighted by the Norwegian government's AI strategy document [1]. Problem Description Problem Description This project is part of a language technology initiative involving Telenor, NRK, National Library of Norway (NLN), and NTNU. The main goal of the initiative, hosted at the Norwegian Open AI Lab, is to improve language technology for the Norwegian language, by focusing on (i) speech-to-text transcription system capable of better transcribing multi-party conversations in realistic recording conditions (SCRIBE) and (ii) making text transcriptions (and thereby also the underlying speech content) available via improved automated metadata generation. In this project, MEGAS, the focus is on the automated metadata generation, including how metadata generated from text data (including transcribed speech) can improve access to, analysis of, utilization of, and overall benefit of the data. In a complementary project, SCRIBE, the goal is to study and develop solutions for machine transcription of Norwegian conversational speech. These two projects are, in other words, mutually beneficial to each other but at the same time somewhat independent. Data Availability Data Availability This project will be using NRK-provided TV-content with subtitle files; we will simply call it NRK\u2019s subtitled TV (NST) dataset.  The NST dataset, with 14,614 entities, consists of TV programs with Norwegian speech along with subtitles. This NST dataset will be interesting in its own right and also a stepping stone towards ASR-generated transcripts.  For this proposed MS Thesis project, in a language technology domain that is already relatively challenging, we believe that starting from relatively clean text data is quite reasonable.  In this project, the main focus will be on automated metadata generation from the subtitles in the NST dataset. Note that we are proposing to use a \u00absimpler\u00bb dataset compared to what one may obtain from ASR-transcriptions from Telenor, NRK, or NLN.   Consequently, the project will have a focus on the text processing aspects of language technology rather than \u00aberror-correcting\u00bb conversational speech transcripts generated using ASR.  Still, there are many challenges to address and results from the proposed project would be useful in the more general and complex setting of ASR transcripts of conversational speech encountered by Telenor, NRK, or NLN. Project and Thesis Descriptions Project and Thesis Descriptions High-quality language technology for Norwegian will strengthen the Norwegian language, enable efficient digitalization and information retrieval, simplify interfaces to public services for citizens, and provide invaluable assistance for people with special needs, to name but a few application areas of impact.  . Good quality metadata in addition to transcripts is required in order to enable such applications. For Norwegian, the capabilities of automated creation and utilization of metadata need to be strengthened, and this will \u2013 at a high level \u2013 be the the goal of this project.  The project can be suitable for one or two students, and the following tasks have been identified. Sketch for the Project Report: Perform a literature review of fundamental and applied algorithms for automated metadata generation (AMG) and similar methods for text.  The ultimate goal is improved AMG methods for transcribed spoken Norwegian, but the review should be broader and focus on problem definitions, mathematical frameworks, algorithms, software, metrics, datasets, and results.. Create a repository and interface for the NST dataset, optimized for AMG tasks, for example the AMG uses cases outlined below.. Discuss how the reviewed AI and ML algorithms and methods can be applied and extended in a resource-constrained language setting, in particular for Norwegian, with an eye towards the NST dataset and its potential applications.   Examples AMG use cases are:  accessibility, keyword and topic generation, content clustering, information retrieval, content summarization, language evolution analysis, and recommender systems.. Identify, adapt, or implement one (or more) simple AMG system(s) and connect it (them) to the NST dataset.  Here, existing AMG methods and systems from the literature will be used as starting points and benchmarks.. Document the work in a written Project Report.

Available simulation environments, the best known perhaps CARLA, focus mainly on realistically looking (photorealistic) appearance of the rendered scenes. They are very well suited for testing computer vision methods (the main perception component in autonomous driving) as well as for testing so-called end-to-end approaches for driving a car. In contrast to this, the present project assumes that a close-to-perfect perception component for the car's environment is already existing, leading to a detailed and precise so-called 'grid map' representation of the dynamic scene around the car. This is what also has (almost) been achieved in the automotive industry. The remaining challenges are more about how to act as a (simulated) driver, \u00a0if perfect knowledge about your environment is given. The main research questions to be addressed when such a simulator is available (as the result of the project proposed here) build on this available grid map representation and deal with the question how to steer and control a car in a dense traffic situation, e.g. in an urban environment during rush hours. In order to allow for this, it is needed to use very realistic vehicle models (which can be bought as 'assets' from the web) and use the same 'intelligent driving agent' an many exemplars of such cyber cars. 'Many' starts from, say, 10 cars, and could go up to several hundred ones, depending on the available computing ressources. In order to create this, a given game engine (currently envisaged: Unity) has to be enabled to be run in kind of a multi-user game fashion, and a realistic, urban-like road network has to be created. The challenge of this project is not photorealism in the visualization of the scene, but the creation of a realistic physics based model of a complex traffic scene, the creation of multiple car-centered abstract representations of the dynamic situation around each single car, and the implementation of an upscalable multi-user multi-agent simulation. In other words: this is not about creating photorealistic videos and processing them, but rather than that, this is about a dynamic simulation of traffic on the basis of a 3D structure representation of the scene. If desired, the project student(s) could also try out control schemes based on e.g. reinforement learning in order to show the overall functionality of the simulator, but the main purpose and goal of the project is the creation of the simulator.

Thus emphasis is not on speed, but on 'intelligence', behaviour, and autonomy. Parallel to this project which needs to first address the mechatronics and the main on-board computing used for communication and control, there is a another project dealing with developing the 'perception component' for the mobile robot. In the ideal case, the students of the \"mobile platform\" (=this project) and the \"perception unit\" projects would cooperate closely, but each project can also be executed individually. Important: the project could also be redefined, in agreement between the supervisor and the student(s) to put most emphasis on the software side of the mobile robot, behaviour, and 'intelligence'.

Starting from an existing collision-tolerant vehicle design you are on one hand encouraged to modify but also to to model it so as to enable the use of reinforcement learning in simulation. You will be provided a planner that allows collision-free navigation and exploration in unknown environments as a reference.

Given its collision-tolerance, \u201csafely\u201d may not necessarily mean with zero collisions and you are challenged with the idea that if a robotic embodiment allows some more tolerance then the navigation function can possibly become more agile and efficient, while remaining safe. The vast amount of training should happen in simulation and combined with selective real-life data (smooth sim-to-real transfer). The derived RL agent is to be implemented onboard the actual robotic system and experiments in safe navigation inside narrow corridors are to be conducted to evaluate its performance.

Supervised learning requires data instances annotated with the correct output labels, but the other paradigms assume no such labelled data. Reinforcement learning is primarily concerned with what actions an intelligent agent (or group of agents) should take in a specified environment in order to maximise some cumulative reward, while simultaneously exploring the environment and exploiting previously accumulated knowledge. The environment is commonly formulated as a Markov decision process or as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), depending on whether the agent can observe the current environmental state directly or whether the observed states are distorted by noise. Reinforcement learning agents have shown strong performance on classical games, making this an interesting approach to test in general in the context of computational creativity.

An alternative can then be to utilise strategies that combine ideas from neural network type set-ups with evolutionary approaches (e.g., compositional pattern-producing networks; Stanley 2007) or model-free reinforcement learning such as Q-learning (or deep Q-learning as introduced by Google DeepMind; Mnih et al. 2015, Silver et al. 2018), which only learns the value of an action in a particular state (stochastic transitions and rewards), without having a model of the environment.

Computer vision for robots, self-driving cars, and also for driver assistance very often assumes very good visibility conditions -- the area is very much dominated by the nice weather conditions that are found when driving e.g. in the Silicon Valley environment. However, autonomous driving or visual driver assistance in the Nordic Countries needs to deal very often with bad weather conditions: rain or snow, thus wet or snow-covered road surfaces, making vision conditions even worse by the froth or spray caused by vehicles in front of the own one. This project deals with the exploration what the combination of machine learning and classicial computer vision methods can do in order to detect other vehicles in a distance, road markings, side barriers, and other obstacles as early and as robustly as possible. One way often being taken in the (sparse) literature about this important topic is to try to improve the quality of the incoming image/video material and subsequently employ 'off-the-shelf' / textbook computer vision algorithms. We do not think that this is the best way to proceed; rather than that, the methods of detecting objects (e.g. in spray, snow, or haze) and the methods for estimating distances and the 3D structure of the environment should consider the afflicted image acquisition process from the very start, and design new algorithms that can cope with the image degradations either by modeling them explicitly (classical approach), or by training learning-based approaches. The topic of visual environment perception and situation assessment under bad visibility conditions is of course not only of interest in conjunction with cars and road traffic, but equally also for marine applications.

Our unique challenge is that the cracks often have irregular shapes such as very thin lines and follow arbitrary directions. The object detection models which output horizontal bounding boxes may not yield satisfied detection results. The object detection model which outputs oriented bounding boxes might provide better detection results (i.e., tightly bound the actual cracks). . Since VOT 2015, rotated bounding box annotations are used by the VOT committee to provide highly accurate ground truth values for comparing results. That means the winners of VOT should have developed the corresponding models/solutions to output rotated bounding boxes.      .

This model is centralized AI, which is working fine now. But in the long-run it could lead to monopolization of the AI market. This could also cause unfair pricing,  lack of transparency, interoperability, privacy issues and excluding smaller companies from AI innovation. Fortunately, there is the emergence of a decentralized AI market, born at the intersection of blockchain, on-device AI and edge computing/IoT.\nIn this project, we will investigate the possibility to build a proof-of-concept of a decentralized AI application through blockchain, such as Ethereum. AI agents will train and learn models from their own data. The decentralized AI application to be developed in this project then can combine multiple algorithms/models (developed by different agents) performing different sub-tasks. One of possible applications is Decentralized Autonomous Cars. 1 - 2 students. We can demonstrate the current result from previous master project as an inspiration. Then we can discuss about the way forward.

Once the plastic reaches the oceans, it is broken down into smaller particles(micro-plastic) by being exposed to ultra violet (UV) radiation and mechanical abrasion from wave actions [1].The quantity of plastic waste floating at the ocean surface in 2013 was estimated to be approximately 269,000 tonnes (small macro- to micro-plastic), this estimate does not include plastic in-depth or at the seafloor). The plastic debris can affect the wildlife in multiple ways, such as entanglement- entrapping, encircling, or constricting,ingestion- accidental ingestion or ingestion of prey containing plastic, and interaction- being in contact with plastic debris [1].It is therefore important to be able to detect and collect the plastic waste in nature,before it reaches the oceans. Once plastic waste has reaches a micro-stadium, it is near impossible to collect it and remove it from the water. An analysis on deep sea locations(range from 1176 to 4843m) showed that there was an average abundance of 1 micro-plastic per 25cm3(particle sizes ranging from 75 to 161\u03bcm) [2] The AI-task will support the observation and monitoring of plastic items\u200b at consumer side, such as cities, beaches..... We will monitor the geographic distribution of different types of plastic items in these areas. The data will be gathered by citizens in form of taking photos of plastic objects. The photos will be taken using an application on smart phones. The application will have an artificial intelligence (deep learning) algorithm specially tailored for recognition of the material type of the plastic in the photos. The combined information about the geographic distribution, plastic type, and the object type (e.g., bottle, bag) pertinent to plastic debris will be collected in a database which in turn will be statistically analyzed and visualized. The smart application will serve as a tool for empowering citizen science and will contribute to the increase of the awareness and collaboration of citizens towards mitigation of plastic pollution problem.

This topic combines modern method of video processing, in particular scene tracking an camera motion estimation with detection methods which today most often come from the domain of machine learning. The approach to the crack detection problem proposed here exploits that idea that cracks typically do not only have a two-dimensional appearance (for instance, like a line drawn on the material), but also have a three-dimensional structure, often a very tiny gap in the surface. It can be expected that a moving camera, in particular when it carries its own illumination, will show the crack not only by its two-dimensional appearance, but also by the change of this appearance, caused by illumination and image acquisition from different viewpoints.. In order to exploit this effect, a set of image frames from the video stream has to \u2018motion-compensated\u2019, that is: the position and orientation of a crack candidate is stabilized in the visual field for a short while, say, for about 3 seconds or 10-100 image frames. Here, temporal subsampling, that is: taking only each n-th frame may be permitted. In the stabilized image subsequence, it is expected that the crack varies in appearance in a typical way which is related to the change of illumination.. The motion-compensated image subsequence is then fed into a detection unit which does not work on a single RGB image, but on a stack of such images. A deep network trained on true (or synthetic) crack images with a CNN in the front end is a highly promising candidate for the detector architecture. Also for this task it will be a challenge to come up with training methods that allow to train the network with a limited set of training images.. A potential side aspect of this task which might turn out to be of key importance to the feasibility of the solution is the attempt to generated synthetic, but still realistic crack images, e.g. by combining real crack images which are artificially augmented by a hallucinated 3D surface structure and \u2018re-illuminated\u2019 using advanced computer graphics methods. This approach is optional, but might develop into a rewarding endeavour for students which are also interest in image rendering.

Revolve is participating to this yearly competition already for a number of years. Each year, a new version of this race car is developed, and of course it is a fundamental goal of the overall Revolve project to achieve a good rank in the annual competition. The project addressed in this Masters or preproject/Masters topic is to develop a solid and precise method for estimating both the ego-motion of the race car as well as the structure of the environment through which this race car moves. With this goal, the project builds on the results and experiences of the previous project / Masters thesis work. The aim is to further increase both the stability as well as the precision of the previous method and experiment with new components and approaches to be used in the context of egomotion estimation and map building. Currently, the egomotion and map building component (here also called 'dynamic state estimation') uses mainly LiDaR measurements to build a map of the environment, which is essentially a plane racing ground and a track which is marked by cones put on the track boundaries. It uses a so-called graph-based SLAM approach, building on available libraries for graph-based optimiization, in particular the iSAM2 library by Kaess, Dellaert et al. In the new approach, the individual components of the existing system will be re-inspected in depth, in particular in the area of data association. This term denotes the process of associating each detected landmark (here: the LiDaR-detected cones) at time instant N with the correctly corresponding landmark at time instant N+1. As the cones all look the same, and as the cone detector will sometimes produce errors (cones missed, or wrong cones hallucinated), this problem is difficult, and it is of utmost importance to make this association right, as even few undetected 'outliers' in the measurements / detection result can lead to catastrophic consequences in the egomotion estimation and map building. The approaches to be investigated in the new version of the SLAM algorithm focus on this data association process. They will explicitly use a dynamic model of the car motion and extensive statistical modeling of the landmark detector reliability as well as statistical modeling of all other sources of error in the data processing process, as far as the tolerable computational effort allows for this. It is also desired that the data association process is implemented using criteria for self-supervision. The possibiliy of multi-hypothesis operation, and using backtracking and 'warm restart' in case of (rare) failures of the overall dynamic state estimation process should be investigated. Optionally, it can be investigated if and where usage of modern machine learning methods may contribute to a safe and solid solution to the dynamic state estimation process. The project requires experience in statistical data analysis, or the willingness to acquire corresponding background knowledge in the preparatory phase, interest or experience in real time programming, and of course some enthusiasm towards the idea of building an 'intelligent car'.

The following research questions are examples - specifics depend on finding a topic of broad and common interest.\u00a0 First, there are opportunities to improve EAs, with an eye to specific applications. Can this done by combining different heuristics and adaptive methods,\u00a0 perhaps including concepts from algorithms for stochastic local search? Second, the computational cost of ML can  currently be high, and the use of EAs for ML is no exception. Maybe Markov chain-based analysis and/or high-performance computing can be the basis for EA-based ML\u00a0methods that better handle massive and complex datasets while reducing computational cost dramatically?

Contact persons: Professor Jo Kramer-Johansen (NAKOS), H\u00e5vard Wahl Kongsg\u00e5rd (NAKOS) Problem Description Problem Description In emergency medicine, time is of the essence. Acute conditions like stroke, myocardial infarction, major trauma, and cardiac arrest, result in loss of vital functions and life within minutes. EMCC is the key to rapid first aid when the public calls them for help by providing first aid instructions, but definitive treatment requires arrival of qualified personnel and often, rapid transport to hospital. However, most cases handled by the EMCC, are of less acuity, and to aid call takers at the EMCC to decide and prioritize, they use a paper-based triage-tool. Both acute and less acute cases may need ambulance transport, and usage of available resources are high and growing. When an ambulance transports a patient, it is not available for other missions, so usage of ambulance resources must balance the current load of missions and availability for the next (unknown) acute case. The current solution involves specially trained and experienced dispatchers (Resource Coordinators \u2013 RC) in the EMCC that manually assigns each mission to an ambulance, maintaining the delicate balance of workload and contingency within geographic regions. EMCC in Oslo is the largest in Norway and answers calls to the medical emergency phone number 113 from a population of 1.6 million (Oslo, Akershus, and \u00d8stfold). The available resources includes 29 (night) to 45 (day) ambulances based at 15 ambulance stations. Each year EMCC handles 500 000 telephone calls, and the Ambulance department executes more than 150 000 missions each year. Data Set Data Set The existing data set is an extract from the clinical data system used in EMCC to record each mission \u2013 (Akuttmedisinsk informasjonssystem, AMIS). Each mission has a position that has been mapped to a standardized 1000 by 1000 m grid from SSB (Statistics Norway). We will anonymize the dataset, but the SSB-grid ties each mission to more sociodemographic information, as well as historical information such as traffic, weather and climate, public events, and moveable public holidays. Each observation is per grid per hour and includes; number of events, response intervals for both acute and non-acute missions, and idle-time. Example information: GRID_ID. DATOTID.

Today, Capeesh produces and delivers bespoke and gamified mobile language courses to industries and businesses that hire and train non-native speakers. This helps businesses in both public and private sectors give people with minority languages the language training they need to conduct their work. Additionally, Capeesh is collaborating with a EU funded project EasyRights, the goal of which is to use AI technology to make it easier for immigrants to understand and access the services they are entitled to. The student that is going to collaborate with Capeesh will be integrated into our development team and a disposable desk at our office in Trondheim. Hence, the student has the possibility to get work experience in a scaling innovative company. Problem Description Problem Description Capeesh is today using a pipeline of NLP technology to automatically create industry-specific language courses. The courses are divided up into vocabulary and comprehension exercises, both encouraging the learner to train on their writing, reading, speaking and listening. The speaking and writing exercises have room for improvement in regards to dialog generation and learner input evaluation and feedback. Hence, we want to apply Custom AI-Generated Text both in speech dialogues and for automatic feedback generation. In addition, we need an AI-agent which can select the most appropriate feedback and learning path recommendation. The feedback would be in the forms of live reaction, briefs (to prepare the learner for what is going to happen in a lesson and what the learner may have difficulties with) and debriefs (to pinpoint what should be the next step). The learning path recommendation would be to suggest the optimal learning path for the learner.

By analyzing kahoots created in the field of geography, other kahoots needed for the user to become a geography expert can be suggested. Logical next step: Similarly, we could identify common learning paths and help suggest logical next steps.

All information may then be stored in a hierarchical knowledge graph to be used by future algorithms or analyses. Named-entity recognition algorithms may subsequently be used to analyze the content.

SUMO is an open source traffic simulator that is developed to simulate realistic road networks. As a side effect it also models the pollutant emissions of vehicles which allows us to model the effect of traffic pollution in an urban scenario. Traffic data is publicly available which can be inputted to the traffic simulator and obtain realistic simulated traffic patterns. This simulator serves as a tool that captures the realistic patterns of air quality data and can be used as an environment to train autonomous agents, both in what concerns to improve air quality levels and the quality of the information on pollution levels.\nTherefore, the goal of this thesis is the deployment of agents that learn, through reinforcement learning or other planning algorithms, from data coming from this simulator. The goal of the agent can be defined on the setup of the project.

Developmental neural networks may be a method toward new network architectures and training regimes that can expand what problem ANNs can efficiently solve.

ANNs was originally proposed as a model for how the brain processes information. The concept emerged as a way to compute and as an abstraction to understand the brain.  ANNs are traditionally defined as a fixed structure. Neurons are spatially defined as part of the Input layer, hidden layers or output layer connected by directed weighted edges. The neurons compute a non-linear function of the sum of its inputs, the edges are a linear transformation (weighted) from neuron output to neuron input. The functionality of the network is a product of the set of weights (and neuron function) present in the network. Generally a feedforward network. The weights for a specific functionality is found by some training algorithm, There is some defined scheme for adjusting the weights based on a performance measurement of the network. Adjustment is based on the performance on the network on some test at current time (t), the network is adjusted and tested again at t + 1, and so on. Currently (in most schemes) the weight adjustment is done weight by weight, there is no dependency between the individual weight adjustments. Even though ANNs now is top of the pops once more with deep learning, convolutional neural networks and all the other buzz around there are few fundamental new principles and methods, i.e. the network architecture is a fixed structure forming a feedforward network, using some training process based on global information.

The idea is to develop a causal model that includes things like exhaust from vehicles, use of studs, wood burning, ship traffic, cleaning of roads, \u2026, and their  impact on air quality.  In other words, the goal is to develop a causal model containing causes and effects related to air quality, perform machine learning from air quality and related data, and improve understanding and decision making related to air quality in many municipalities. The project is inspired by a report \"Driftstiltak mot svevest\u00f8v i Trondheim kommune:  Erfaringsrapport for tiltak f\u00f8r og etter 2013,\" where one finds the following quote on page 2 (see also Figure 1 in the report):  . \"Trolig har samtlige tiltak bidratt til at det nasjonale m\u00e5let [for luftkvalitet] ble tilfredsstilt i 2015.

The analysis will be performed by constructing a causal model containing both observable and latent random random variables along with their causal connections, and performing machine learning and analysis of air quality and related datasets. Such a causal model can be used for several purposes; we propose to study the following: Intervention analysis: which intervention(s) to perform in a certain situation of poor air quality?. Counterfactual analysis: which of the many actions taken from 2000 to 2013  were the main causes of improvements in air quality?  In other words, had the action(s) not been taken, would the improvements in air quality not have happened?

While the idea is to start with datasets for Trondheim, it would be useful for these concepts to be defined in a generic manner such that they can be used in other municipal cases as well.  In other words, it should be part of the project to study (i) the transfer of (parts of) the causal model between cities or municipalities or or (ii) how to adapt the model to different municipalities.  If such transfer or adaptation is possible, there can be great value in air quality decision making in many municipalities.

Problem Description Problem Description At SINTEF, we are often asked to assess ocean locations with respect to environmental properties or marine activities with respect to environmental risk. In order to do that, it is preferable to have several years with modelled ocean data to account for different seasons and yearly variations in conditions. It is hard for a human to understand these data and to pick periods or areas that are relevant or typical for the application. Per today these data are analysed with normal statistics, like means / max / variations. For operations planning or planned discharges it would be nice to understand patterns in the data and either find suitable periods or areas in the ocean or be able to exclude them for protection. Thesis Description Thesis Description Machine learning for effective ocean data analysis Apply different machine learning methods to find commonalities in ocean data that are meaningful to marine operations (pollution transport, aquaculture). Ocean data is 4 dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions plus time, so the data is like several sensor readings (currents, temperature, salinity) over time and in space (like cubes in a Rubik cube, with each cube being several sensors). We want to understand the correlation and patterns in these data. Data Data We can use data that is available from met via https://thredds.met.no/ and possibly combine modelled (Ocean & Ice, Norkyst800) with observations (Observations, SVV E39) and aquaculture production data from Barentswatch https://www.barentswatch.no/havbruk/?

RE of software is applied where the original source code for a program is missing, proprietary, or otherwise unavailable. Motivation for RE ranges from extending support of legacy software to discovery of security vulnerabilities to creating open source alternatives to proprietary software. RE usually targets binary programs with a known instruction set architecture (ISA) and executable format. The RE process proceeds by disassembling the binary into assembly code, and where possible decompiling the assembly to yield high-level source code (for example, C source code). However, in many cases the ISA is either undocumented, unknown, or unavailable. In addition, malware has been shown to use custom virtual machines to avoid detection. Such cases prove extremely time intensive for the reverse engineer. ISA features such as word size, instruction format, register size, and number of physical registers are a prerequisite to disassembly. This project aims to discover to what extent machine learning can be used to detect ISA features from binaries of unknown provenance, and if so, whether these features can be used to help disassemble the binary program so that instruction and control flow information can be recovered.

More often than not, the analyses deal with the issue by analysing only a single dataset at time, as the biases are difficult to accurately describe. Ironically, combining datasets with different biases can be used to identify and eliminate the biases, and keep only the genuine biological variation. The goal of this project is creating a machine-learning algorithm to automatically identify consistent expression profiles in biological data, and biases associated to individual experiment designs. The student will learn how to apply machine learning to real-world data. The problem may be approached both as designing an estimator or creating a classifier. The expression profiles can be perceived as signals at a higher abstraction level, and a thorough understanding of the biology behind is not necessary. Nevertheless, basic understanding of the experimental designs will be required to adequately massage the data for the machine-learning model. The focus is mainly on RNA expression data, and should include microarray and RNA-seq data. Relevant experimental designs to include in the work are time-series experiments (measurements at time-intervals following introduction of/release from a treatment) and data comparing two experimental conditions. An example of the former might be measuring expression throughout cell-cycle upon releasing the cell culture from a treatment blocking the cell culture to progress past a certain point in the cell cycle. An example of the latter could be siRNA screens, where a given RNA is post-transcriptionally degraded by introducing a specifically designed siRNA. The topic is research-oriented, and students can choose whichever machine-learning approach and programming language they deem convenient.

The emphasis will be on the integration of methods from evolutionary algorithms and stochastic local search, with a focus on both theory and applications. In artificial intelligence and machine learning, there are several methods that use or rely on randomization: mutation and crossover in evolutionary algorithms [Goldberg, 1989], probabilistic acceptance in simulated annealing, dropout and stochastic gradient descent in deep learning, stochastic local search (SLS) [Selman et al., 1992] [Hoos & St\u00fctzle, 2005] [Mengshoel et al., 1998], and randomization in systematic search [Gomes et al., 1998]. Stochastic optimization (SO) algorithms, which include stochastic local search (SLS) and evolutionary algorithms (EAs), will be a main focus in this project.    Stochastic optimization (SO) algorithms are among the best in solving computationally hard problems including NP-hard problems such as satisfiability (SAT), traveling salesman (TSP), scheduling, and most probable explanations in Bayesian networks (BNs) [Selman et al., 1992] [Hoos & St\u00fctzle, 2005] [Mengshoel et al., 2010] [Mengshoel et al., 2016] [Pal & Mengshoel, 2016]. Research on SO performed by me and my collaborators has focused on (i) improving the theoretical foundation of SO; (ii) empirically demonstrating the benefit of SO using natural and synthetic problem instances; and (iiii) applying the approach in diverse areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning. For (i), we have for instance analyzed homogenous Markov chains to derive instructive expected hitting time results [Mengshoel, 2008] [Mengshoel et al., 2016]. For (ii) and (iii), we have demonstrated that SO algorithms can be competitive for applications including computing the most probably explanation (MPE) in Bayesian networks; feature selection in machine learning; and sparse signal recovery in signal processing [Mengshoel et al., 2010] [Mengshoel et al., 2011] [Mengshoel et al., 2014] [Pal & Mengshoel, 2016] [Yu et al., 2017] [Liu et al., 2018]. Despite several successes, the current state-of-the-art suffers from some drawbacks, creating research opportunities in several areas. In this research project, we will explore those opportunities and develop novel ideas at the interface of stochastic local search, machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, probabilistic graphical models, and deep learning.  Special attention will be paid to multimodal functions, which play a central role in artificial intelligence and evolutionary algorithms. There appears to be several limiting factors when it comes to existing work on SO for such multimodal functions, including the following. Firsrt, multimodal optimization algorithms often search for \u201cas many local optima as possible\u201d without input or guidance from a decision maker. Second, evolutionary algorithms have been used for certain combinatorial optimization problems including feature selection, but there has been surprisingly little emphasis on diversity maintenance including niching in research on machine learning including feature selection. The integration of local search and evolutionary algorithms has, to some extent, been studied in the literature, often under the term memetic algorithms (MAs) [Eiben & Smith, 2015] [Krasnogor & Smith, 2005] [Xue et al., 2016]. Intuitively, the goal of an MA is for the EA component to search well globally, while the SLS component\u2019s goal is to optimize locally. In other words, one wants \u201cthe best of both worlds.\u201d There is a broad diversity of different MA types and designs [Krasnogor & Smith, 2005] [Xue et al., 2016]. Both Lamarckian and Baldwinian MAs have been studied, reflecting the spirited discussion between Lamarck and Baldwin in evolutionary biology in the late 1800. Current research seems to favor Lamarckian MAs, in which the locally optimized individual replaces the original individual in the population. Focus in Project Focus in Project The focus of the project is on the integration of SLS and EA methods, inspired by so-called memetic algorithms (MAs), to be analyzed and tested on synthetic and natural problems.  Several MA-based approaches to feature selection [Kannan & Ramaraj, 2010] [Xue et al., 2016] [Lee et al., 2019] have been developed, inspiring this proposed research project. To be investigated are methods that addresses the issues identified above, and perhaps others, by integrating multiple different methods, and carefully balancing their execution via parameter tuning and control [Krafotias et al., 2015] [Mengshoel et al., 2014] [Mengshoel et al., 2016] [Yu et al., 2017]. An interesting idea is to combine stochastic local search, evolutionary computing, clustering, and feedback control algorithms, with emphasis on the balance between exploration and exploitation during search. Such balance can be achieved by means of niching, for example crowding [Mengshoel et al., 2014].  The goal will be to empirically test such a multi-method algorithm on synthetic and natural combinatorial function optimization problems, including ML problems (for example feature selection or network search problems), and empirically establish performance relative to other methods. For the more theoretically oriented student, theory development would be of great interest [Mengshoel, 2008] [Nguyen & Sudholt, 2020]. The project can be suitable for one or two students.  The students will participate in one or more of the following tasks in this proposed project: Identify or develop limitations or problems with the current SO state-of-the-art, with focus on  memetic algorithms (MAs) [Kannan & Ramaraj, 2010]  [Xue et al., 2016] [Lee et al., 2019] [Nguyen & Sudholt, 2020], structure search [Elsken et al., 2019]; hyper-parameter optimization [Krafotias et al., 2015] [Mengshoel et al., 2016] [Yu et al., 2017]; and impact of varying computational context (data set, problem, computer, \u2026 )..

Identify and/or improve and/or implement existing SO algorithms, by focusing on specific computational problems, algorithms, and computational platforms.   Here, optimization for machine learning, explainable AI, decision support, and human computer interaction (image captioning, for example) are example problems..

When studying eukaryotic cell cycle, the most common approach involves synchronizing a cell culture. In this method, the cells, grown in a medium, are prevented to progress through the cell cycle past a certain phase, usually through use of a chemical agent. The block is then released, and the cells are allowed to progress through the cell cycle. We can assign each cell a phase angle \u03b1, representing its progress in the cell cycle. Then, we can describe the cell-cycle phase distribution of a culture. Moreover, for cell-cycle related genes, we may represent their expression as a function of \u03b1. An unsynchronized culture will then attain an equilibrium distribution, whereas a synchronized culture starts with a narrow phase distribution, which then evolves in time upon release of the block, converging to the said equilibrium distribution. In this project, the student should create a model that captures the evolution of cell-cycle phase distribution in time, upon synchronizing cells of different types, using different synchronization methods. Specifically, certain synchronization methods cause initially slower, or vice versa faster, cell cycle. Moreover, the cells may not behave completely alike to one another, but may rather feature several distinct populations. A model for this stratification might take as a starting point data from single cell sequencing. Besides the advancements for fundamental research, such a model should prove useful in deconvolving and interpolating expression profiles from different experiments, thereby making the data comparable. The current state-of-the-art models are rather unsophisticated, and a student might very well come up with a state-of-the-art model, applying known methods of function approximation, machine learning, or even generalizing certain models from physics. The model would be tested and verified on synthetic, as well as experimental data on phase distribution in experiments (fluorescence-activated cell sorting data), and in cooperation with the student applied to the existing analyses in our group.

This project is a joint project of Akvaplan-niva AS and NTNU.\n\nProblem description: In recent years, the use of Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) for research and mitigation purposes has dramatically increased, with new studies encouraging its use. Acoustic data provide scientific insights in a broad range of fields including animal vocalizations (biophony) and anthropogenic noise (anthrophony) in the marine environment. Yet, the amount of human effort required to manually identify acoustic features and events rapidly becomes limiting as the size of the data sets increase. Machine learning has the potential to handle large data sets and address many questions in the field of passive acoustic such as automatic detection and classification of sound events. However, the sound from these sources reverberates in the environment which profoundly distorts the original source waveform or can be masked by other sounds overlapping in time and frequencies. Thus the signal recorded usually contains a mixture of highly variable unknown sources, each distorted by the environment in an unknown fashion. Moreover, the noise produced by system events of unmanned autonomous vehicles (gliders) while carrying the hydrophones can saturate the recordings. This issue can mask the detections. Some of the suggested objectives: \u2022 Develop an automatic system able to detect and identify non-biological sound sources. \u2022 Detection of events with time overlap between biotic and abiotic sound sources. \u2022 Develop an algorithm able to automatically identify and filter out the noise events produced by the gliders To achieve the above goals, this project is divided into the following sub-projects: I. Investigate the possibility of applying existing state-of-the-art deep learning methods to solve the above tasks. As part of this, the candidate is expected to perform a state-of-the-art literature review and implement the most relevant method(s) to create automatic detector(s) that can solve the problem. II.

To reach the EU goal of cutting carbon emissions from the building sector there are two main strategies: increase building efficiency and increase the low/zero carbon energy sources [1]. According to IEA, an increase in CO2 price and a stronger interconnection of the power grid between Norway and continental Europe is expected in the future.. The exchange of power with neighbouring countries will therefore strongly influence the CO2 intensity (CO2eq) of the electricity mix. The analysis of this parameter is of high importance, as it indicates the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix. The CO2eq. intensity can be used as a penalty signal in buildings to trigger certain delayable functions (such as the use of machines or power or heat accumulation) and shift their operation towards times in which the fraction of renewable energy in the energy mix is highest. Doing so, the use of the CO2eq. intensity as penalty signal can help to reduce overall emissions from energy systems, especially on the demand side.. Some scholars have started studying the possibility of development of machine learning algorithms that are able to forecast the CO2 emission intensity of the power grid [2,3]. An interesting improvement of this methods will be the development of a method to forecast the marginal CO2eq [4].   Data Data We recommend the use of grid data (gathered online) such as the hourly electricity generation per generation technology per bidding zone, which can be retrieved from ENTSO-E.

The autonomous technology company Zeabuz (POC Dr. Smogeli), which is located in Trondheim, is developing autonomous urban passenger ferries and seeking to perform state-of-the-art safety validation. Safety is also a key challenge in aerospace, and the concepts of adaptive stress testing has been developed by NASA ARC (POC Dr. Lee) and NASA\u2019s partners to meet that challenge. At NTNU, the Norwegian Open AI Lab (advisor Prof. Mengshoel) will be hosting the students working on the project. It is forecast that a steadily increasing percentage of the world population will be living in cities. However, city growth is often limited by lack of scalable infrastructure and congested road traffic leading to excessive emissions. At the same time, many cities are built by historical waterways such as lakes, rivers, canals, bays, fjords or harbour basins. Often, these waterways are largely unused, while they separate districts and limit mobility. Meeting these challenges with bridges and tunnels is a costly, non-scalable and inflexible solution, causing a large footprint while not meeting future problems due to likely increasing water levels. In contrast, establishing shortcuts across and along existing waterways that connect and revitalize urban areas is a sustainable, flexible, efficient and compelling solution for cities and citizens. Zeabuz is developing core technologies and solutions that can enable more environmentally friendly and flexible mobility solutions in urban areas. The Zeabuz mobility system consists of a network of electric, autonomous passenger ferries with centrally located docking and charging stations, high bandwidth communication and a remote support centre. NTNU and Zeabuz are together deploying the milliAmpere 2 (mA2) pilot ferry for trial operation in Trondheim in the summer of 2021. The mA2 will be a fully operational passenger ferry with an autonomy system developed by NTNU researchers, designed to operate along a fixed path across the canal between Ravnkloa and Vestre Kanalkai. The autonomy system shall be able to avoid objects and handle any traffic situation that could occur in this Operational Design Domain (ODD). In parallel, NTNU and Zeabuz are developing an mA2 digital twin, which is a complete simulator of the autonomous ferry and its operating environment in the Trondheim canal. This enables simulation of any kind of operational scenario in a synthetic environment. Problem Description Problem Description The Zeabuz autonomous mobility system is a complex, software intensive system, enabled by artificial intelligence and subject to an unpredictable operating environment, that needs to be actively managed throughout its life-cycle. This makes formal safety proofs (practically) impossible. Instead, one needs to resort to statistical considerations in the safety argumentation. In other words, there is a need to argue \u2013 based on the accumulated experience, testing, verification and validation activities we have collected \u2013 that the system is sufficiently safe. Experience from the aerospace and automotive industries, which have been dealing with similar challenges for autonomous aircraft and cars for some time, shows that testing and real-world experience is not sufficient \u2013 even with a large fleet of aircraft or cars.  The reason for this is that the number of possible critical scenarios the system needs to handle is practically unlimited. The only viable solution appears to be large-scale simulations of the system and its environment, where the full parameter space of possible scenarios in principle can be explored [2]. However, this triggers the problem of designing and selecting which scenarios to run among the near infinite number of possible parameter combinations. Example questions that show up are: How to ensure that scenarios are relevant and representative? How to cover the critical \u201ccorner cases\u201d? How to find the \u201cweak spots\u201d in the system and force it towards failure? How to evaluate the system performance? To solve these issues, we need a systematic and effective way of designing, running, and evaluating simulation scenarios that together give sufficient confidence in the safety of the Zeabuz autonomous ferry system.  This proposed MS project will be contributing towards this goal.

The students will get access to the milliAmpere 2 digital twin, which is a complete simulator of the autonomous ferry and its operating environment in the Trondheim canal. For this project, the simulations can be parameterized in terms of the traffic situation, meaning the candidate can specify what kind of vessels that will be part of the scene and how they will move and act with respect to mA2. In principle, any kind of operational scenario can be designed and deployed in the mA2 digital twin, meaning it can serve as the backbone of such a test system. Depending on actual data availability, the candidate may also get access to full-scale data from experiments, if this is found to be of relevance. Project and Thesis Descriptions Project and Thesis Descriptions The thesis will employ, adapt and extend a method called adaptive stress testing (AST) to find likely failure events of the autonomy system in mA2, using reinforcement learning (RL) and other AI and ML techniques [1,2,3,4,5]. The AST method has previously been used to validate aircraft collision avoidance systems [3,4,5], which is a similar problem. Sketch for the Project Report: Perform a literature review of AST and similar methods.. Discuss how the reviewed methods can be deployed for an autonomous passenger ferry, specifically the Zeabuz ferry.. Design and implement an AST system and connect this to the mA2 digital twin. Here, the existing AST package POMDPStressTesting.jl (see http://ritchielee.net/software/ and https://github.com/sisl/POMDPStressTesting.jl)  or another open source AST package will be used as a starting point.. Perform initial simulations with the AST system and identify potential weaknesses in the autonomy system.. Document the work in a written Project Report.

Regarding \u00abalgorithmic extensions to AST\u00bb as mentioned above:  Since AST is based on RL, exploration of these ideas will first start on the RL side, and then be adapted to AST based on experiences with the Zeabuz requirements and simulation. Here are some ideas for such algorithmic extensions: Multi-objective or constrained reinforcement learning formulation: Currently two objectives are blended by a weight in AST [4].  One can handle this more elegantly with a multi-objective or constraint framework.  Here, the idea is to study multi-objective RL or constrained RL for AST.. Uncertainty estimation of AST results: Currently, AST uses RL as a solver, which doesn't return any uncertainty/confidence on the results. It would be interesting to explore uncertainty or confidence RL frameworks for AST: Deep ensembles, Bayesian methods, etc.. Improve exploration in RL in AST by: (i) tweaking the starting distribution or (ii) exploring diversity-, curiosity-, entropy-, or novelty-driven RL for AST. For (ii) the idea is to study methods such as DIAYN; another related idea is curriculum RL.

The main idea is that ego-motion of a robot can be learned from the visual input in combination with data from an inertial measurement uni (IMU) which is able to sense translational acceleration and rotational velocity. This is (hypothetically) the same way how humans and animals learn to perceive their motion, by combining data from visual input and the inner ear (sense of balance). In the project, a suitable camera with build-in IMU (Intel Realsense) shall be used to first collect extensive data (video and IMU recordings), and then in step 2 design an architecture that learns to derive the desired information (translation and rotation of the camera) from that data. We think of really huge data sets in the order of magnitude of 1 Terabyte as the relation to be learned is more complex as this simplified project description can convey. One important principle to be followed in this project is that we search for an architecture which is as sparse as possible while being still in the position to solve the given problem reliably. This means, it is _not_ intended to \"simply\" try a very deep architecture and solve the problem by computational overkill. The basis for this \"sparse\" and efficient solution is that quite a lot is known about motion perception in biological systems and in computer vision. The front end of the envisaged structure is a CNN with a spatio-temporal (that is: 3dimensional) input layer, 1 time dimension and 2 spatial dimensions. In other words, the primary information processing layer does not only work on 2 images (as in many approaches), but on a stack of N images, N >>2. This refers to the fact that the projection of most motions onto the retina (or camera image plane) is mostly a smooth curve; things do not oscillate wildly when we regard them, but they move (mostly) smoothly across the image plane. The output of this CNN is a (coarse) estimate of the so called \"optical flow fleld\", but in contrast to most conventional schemes, the output is not (only) a 2D motion vector, but comes in terms of a vector of latent variables that describe the local motion in a richer, more informative way. This first layer will be tranined essentially like an auto-encoder network. During the training process, it will be investigated whether is is useful to include the measurements from the IMU into the loss function. This first \u00a0layer with a coarse subsampling of the \"extended optical flow\" field is subsequently fed into a second network which,given the already trained first CNN layer is trained to provide, together with the inertial measurement unit, the final ego-motion data, that is: the translational and rotational motion of the camera. This project is well suited for a student (or two students) who do not only have some initial knowledge about visual computing (e.g. from\u00a0TDT4195 - Visual Computing Fundamentals) and deep learning (e.g.\u00a0TDT4265 Computer Vision and Deep Learning) --- such knowledge is essential ---, but are also interested in thorough mathematical analysis and modeling of the regarded problem, and are interested in a _structured_ solution architecture that reflects all the known facts about the problem. So the ability and the willingness to regard the problem also from the mathematical and statistical side is a requirement. In the ideal case, the student(s) will be supported to report about their results not only in a thesis, but also in a conference paper. This is an option, but not a stringent requirement.

It is getting difficult every day to keep up with threats and vulnerabilities associated with these tools, apps or websites, especially for children. In the recent years we have assisted to a series of problems generated by the use of software by children. These problems arise from the use of both general software like Facebook and Instagram and specific software for children. Children can fall victim to cyber security threats like social engineering, cyber bullying, hacking, viruses, and damaging malware, cyber stalking, etc. through search engines, online advertisements and social networking websites such as Facebook, Twitter and lots of other websites [4]. Mental health issues and even suicide are been caused by interaction with software. Instagram removed nearly 10,000 images related to suicide and self harm every day in the months following the Molly Russell scandal(according to https://www.telegraph.co.uk). Physical health issues, like obesity [12] and diabetes are been caused by use of videogames.. Given the greater exposure of children to these technologies, the design research community takes into account children\u2019s abilities, interests, and developmental needs [6] when designing interfaces of software for children. In previous studies we have addressed creativity software for children [9]; exergames [3]; and software for motivating adolescents with Intellectual Disabilities [7]. As far as our knowledge, a categorization of software for children which balance creativity, security, and the various dimensions of child well-being (physical, mental, and social) have not been proposed. An emphasis will be put on studying existing software for children and develop a set of enablers(or characteristics) for good software for children. Ethics, privacy, explanability, cybersecurity, and children well-being will have to be integral part of the processes, so that the children who use software systems will be offered new possibilities and made aware of threads.    The student(s) will:. Run a systematic literature review and prepare a paper for journal. Plan an empirical investigation. Run an empirical investigation (data collection, data analysis) with children and/or software engineers as subjects. Propose new Software Engineering\u00a0 knowledge for children as stakeholders . Paper Writing for Conference, like ICSE Society Track      The supervisor will provide the student(s) with Initial Literature and help the student(s) to access to Stakeholders and initial data for the Empirical Investigation. If the project will be run as a 15 + 30 project, I expect that during the Autumn semester the student(s) will implement steps 1 and 2 and during Spring Semester steps 3,4,5.. The supervisor wish to interact with the master students and organize workshops and supervision sessions weekly.   References. [1] S. Easterbrook, J. Singer, M.-A. Storey, and D. Damian.

I denne tiden g\u00e5r sauen fritt i skog og fjell med tilsyn i prinsippet en gang i uka. Sanking av sauene om h\u00f8sten er en flertrinnsoperasjon som normalt tar et antall uker.

SLS algorithms, which we study here, are competitive in solving computationally hard problems such as satisfiability (SAT), sparse signal recovery, scheduling, and most probable explanations in Bayesian networks (BNs).  Essentially, SLS algorithms are greedy optimizers that also make random moves in order to avoid getting trapped in local but non-global optima.\u00a0\u00a0Further, SLS algorithms are interesting in that they can studied formally, for example by means of Markov chains. The goal of this project and thesis is to study the theory and application of SLS.  The following research questions are examples - specifics depend on finding a topic of broad and common interest.\u00a0 First, there are opportunities to improve SLS, with an eye to specific applications. Can this done by combining different heuristics and adaptive methods,\u00a0 perhaps including concepts from bio-inspired AI including evolutionary algorithms? Second, the computational cost of ML can  currently be high, and the use of SLS for ML, for example for feature selection by means of wrapper methods, is no exception. Maybe Markov chain-based analysis and/or high-performance computing can be the basis for SLS methods that better handle massive and complex datasets while reducing computational cost dramatically? Third, the theory and formal methods communities have also studied parametric Markov chains, but interactions with the AI and ML communities have been limited.

We focus on a fundamental optimization problem in machine learning. Successfully solving this problem will improve a wide range of tasks, for example, cluster analysis, topic discovery, signal processing, recommendation. In the above machine learning tasks, the model is often parameterized by nonnegative matrices (or vectors). The learning, implemented by convectional additive gradient based optimization, is inefficient in finding the relative scales among the matrix entries. It has been shown that multiplicative updates are an effective way to overcome the drawback. However, multiplicative updates currently are in batch mode. That is, the whole data set is used in each update, which can cause slow convergence and are prone to poor stationary points. In this project we propose to improve the optimization by combining multiplicative updates and stochastic gradient descent, where the resulting method is called stochastic multiplicative updates.

They usually require large sets of labeled training data. In this project, we address the problem of detecting objects in images / video by building up or learning _structured_ object models, that is: a composition of parts that make up the particular class of objects. Most objects of interests (human beings, animals, cars, buildings, ...) can be described as being built up by such parts. The research question to be addressed is whether from first training a conventional deep learning-based object detector, and subsequently analyzing the found and parameterized network, these parts can be found automatically, or possibly semi-automatically. If such a parts structure has been found, the approach to be followed is to itentify part detectors speciallized on these parts, and build up a structured 'decision system' that processes the results of the part detectors, the geometrical locations of the detected parts, the confidence level of the individual detections, and the relations between these parts. The hypothesis to be followed by this approach is that a statisitically optimum object detector can be built from combining the expressive power of deep neetworks in the part detectors, and the solid mathematical basis of making decisions based on the fusion of different object cues (location, geometrical relation, individual detection confidence). This architecture is supposed to have also the advantage of being 'explainable by construction', a requirement very often found these days for any serious application of machine learning in safety-critical environments.

In my world there is a difference between the concepts of learning and training. Learning is the concept of the brain. The brain changes it structure and functionality to adapt to the environment (may say learn to handle a task/problem). The underlying processes of learning are mostly unknown. Even if the processes of learning are unknown, there are some concepts at a higher abstraction level that are known, e.g. local communication, local information, local control vast parallelist and emergence. The concept of Artificial Neural Networks is training. Training uses some form of global control. Training has global information available. Training is (mostly) sequential. ANN is currently very successful solving problems that are hard to solve using traditional programming methods. One of the costs of the success is power. A supercomputer (like the one at NTNU) uses MW of power. Training is a time-consuming process, as such, training cost energy, time * power, training for a day cost can be 24 hours * 1 MW = 24 MWh. One observable property of the brain is power, the brain uses approx. 40W. ANNs uses mostly floating-point data, e.g. 64 bit. The brain uses pulses and analogue values. In resent research it has been shown that when trained an ANN's accuracy can be reduced, e.g. from 64 bit float down to far less precision, even down to binary (Binarized Neural Network). Such an reduction can make a system extremely much more energy efficient. However, such an reduction is done from a trained network. The training was executed at a high precision level. Binarized Neural Network In this project the goal is to get insight in the relationship between high precision and low precision networks by exploring the search landscape of high accuracy network versus low accuracy(binary) network.

In general, simulations on language evolution tend to have relatively small and fixed population sizes, something this study could aim to change.

If a sufficient number of such points are tracked between two images, the relative pose (=translation and rotation) of the camera can be estimated. As any measurement in images is afflicted by errors, both these pose estimates as well as the estimated 3D positions of the observed image points are uncertain, and the estimation of the complete camera trajectory as well as the scene model \u201cstitched together\u201d from many views needs to be input data to a huge optimization problem.\nIn AROS, we have access to both real video footage from underwater missions, as well as a realistic simulation environment which is able to generate video sequences where the motion and the 3D geometry are precisely known (\u2018ground truth\u2019). The student project is integrated into our design and development process for a vSLAM system which is specifically tuned to be able with the substantial problems of underwater video material: limited visibility due to turbid water, bad illumination which is also moving with the robot vehicle, disturbances by plankton, dirt, and small fish, and many more.  Which part of the vSLAM development is determined to be the focus area of the student project is subject to negotiation; the intention is to let the students experiment with novel approaches proposed in the recent literature, some of them focusing on geometric models and statistical estimation theory, others on machine learning. So we are able to adapt the topic largely to the background knowledge the student(s) already have, and their interest into different relevant research fields, such as e.g. state estimation, optimization, object detection and tracking, machine learning and deep learning.

The vehicle routing problem with drones (VRPD) is an extension of VRP, where  drones or a tandem strategy of trucks and drones are involved in the delivery of parcels to customers. One application area of interest is the delivery of small medical packages to inaccessible, remote or dense urban areas where such packets may include blood samples, medicines and vaccines.

Three-quarters of these cases occur in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, showing that low-income countries lack the tools and processes needed to deal with the condition adequately. Contrary, there are very few cases of deaths and brain damages occurring in high-income countries, roughly 1 in every 100000 births. Still, in high-income countries vast resources are spent dealing with the condition, with jaundice being the number one reason for readmissions to the hospital after birth [4].\n\nWeakly Supervised Approach for Detecting Important Pixels\nWe hypothesize that certain pixels or clusters of pixels of a skin image do not provide any predictive information and may confuse some types of estimation methods. For example, highlights or shadows are such types of pixel clusters that most likely do not contribute to an accurate estimation of bilirubin.\n\nRQ: How can we learn without any labeled data (ground truth masks) a model that would be able to identify pixels that contribute to an accurate bilirubin estimation?\n\nHere we have several promising and detailed hypotheses to test, but they may require a low level (mathematical) understanding of neural nets.\n\nThe potential contributions are at least threefold:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.

The dashboard provides the educational facilitator (i.e., instructor or parent) with a real-time visualisation of the learners cognitive, affective and physiological state based on the collected MMD. AI components will produce feedback mechanisms, which may be delivered directly to the learner, or to their educational facilitator.  Thesis Description.

The techniques that exploit memory level parallelism (MLP) try to mitigate the bottleneck by hiding the latency of later requests, at least partially, under the shadow of earlier requests. Runahead execution [1] is a powerful technique to exploit memory level parallelism in out-of-order cores. It checkpoints the current core state when the ROB\u00a0is full and stalled, flushes the ROB (and other required structures), and start to fetch and execute instructions speculatively. The instructions in the runahead mode are executed if their operands are available, thus generating additional memory accesses and improving MLP. However, the coverage of runahead execution is limited because it comes into play only when the instruction window has been blocked (i.e when ROB\u00a0is full). This project will explore alternatives to employ runahead execution even when the ROB is not full. For more information of runahead execution, please read the following papers: [1] https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/pub/mutlu_hpca03.pdf [2] https://hps.ece.utexas.edu/people/milad/pub/runaheadBuffer_micro2015.pdf", "Innvevde"], ["Improving Branch Prediction Accuracy for Cloud Applications", "Rakesh Kumar", "Valgbart", "Gruppe / En eller flere studenter", "https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2941", "Contemporary cloud applications\u00a0(such as search, video streaming, social media etc.)   feature   massive instruction   footprints   stemming   from   deep,   layered   software stacks. As a side effect of these massive footprints, the branch working set of these applications is also gigantic which complicates detecting and predicting these branches accurately at the fetch stage. The two key components required for branch prediction are: 1) Branch target buffer (BTB) that detects branches before the instructions are even fetched and 2)\u00a0Branch predictor that predicts the direction of conditional branches (taken/not-taken). This project targets to improve both of these components as follows: 1)\u00a0Branch target buffer (BTB):\u00a0BTB is a table that determine whether a program counter (PC) corresponds to a branch instruction or not. However, given the huge number of branches in cloud applications, BTB misses are frequent.

It means that we can no longer burn more power to achieve higher performance; rather we have to increase the power-efficiency of a system to achieve higher performance within the same power budget. Instruction scheduling is the most complex and power intensive operation in modern out-of-order (OoO) cores accounting for up to 40% of core power consumption[1]. The following projects, leading to subsequent theses, aim to design power-efficient instruction scheduling mechanisms for OoO cores: 1)\u00a0Criticality aware instruction scheduling: Current instruction scheduling mechanisms prioritize critical instructions over the non-critical ones; nonetheless, they treat all critical instructions equally[2]. However, not all critical instructions contribute equally to the performance. This project will explore quantifying the criticality of critical instructions to prioritize allocation of limited number of power hungry resources. It will explore different criticality metrices and their trade-offs. 2) Instruction Scheduling in SMT\u00a0cores: Simultaneous multi-threaded (SMT) processors share core resources among multiple threads and hence put even more pressure on instruction scheduling. Our recent work [3] has shown that the complexity of instruction scheduling can be significantly reduced by exploiting instruction characteristics such as criticality and readiness. Though this work is limited only to single threaded cores. This project will build on this work and explore mechanisms to reduce instruction scheduling complexity in SMT out-of-order cores. The availability of multiple threads in SMT cores provides opportunities to further reduce the instruction scheduling complexity.

The main idea is that ego-motion of a robot can be learned from the visual input in combination with data from an inertial measurement uni (IMU) which is able to sense translational acceleration and rotational velocity. This is (hypothetically) the same way how humans and animals learn to perceive their motion, by combining data from visual input and the inner ear (sense of balance). In the project, a suitable camera with build-in IMU (Intel Realsense) shall be used to first collect extensive data (video and IMU recordings), and then in step 2 design an architecture that learns to derive the desired information (translation and rotation of the camera) from that data. We think of really huge data sets in the order of magnitude of 1 Terabyte as the relation to be learned is more complex as this simplified project description can convey. One important principle to be followed in this project is that we search for an architecture which is as sparse as possible while being still in the position to solve the given problem reliably. This means, it is _not_ intended to \"simply\" try a very deep architecture and solve the problem by computational overkill. The basis for this \"sparse\" and efficient solution is that quite a lot is known about motion perception in biological systems and in computer vision. The front end of the envisaged structure is a CNN with a spatio-temporal (that is: 3dimensional) input layer, 1 time dimension and 2 spatial dimensions. In other words, the primary information processing layer does not only work on 2 images (as in many approaches), but on a stack of N images, N >>2. This refers to the fact that the projection of most motions onto the retina (or camera image plane) is mostly a smooth curve; things do not oscillate wildly when we regard them, but they move (mostly) smoothly across the image plane. The output of this CNN is a (coarse) estimate of the so called \"optical flow fleld\", but in contrast to most conventional schemes, the output is not (only) a 2D motion vector, but comes in terms of a vector of latent variables that describe the local motion in a richer, more informative way. This first layer will be tranined essentially like an auto-encoder network. During the training process, it will be investigated whether is is useful to include the measurements from the IMU into the loss function. This first \u00a0layer with a coarse subsampling of the \"extended optical flow\" field is subsequently fed into a second network which,given the already trained first CNN layer is trained to provide, together with the inertial measurement unit, the final ego-motion data, that is: the translational and rotational motion of the camera. This project is well suited for a student (or two students) who do not only have some initial knowledge about visual computing (e.g. from\u00a0TDT4195 - Visual Computing Fundamentals) and deep learning (e.g.\u00a0TDT4265 Computer Vision and Deep Learning) --- such knowledge is essential ---, but are also interested in thorough mathematical analysis and modeling of the regarded problem, and are interested in a _structured_ solution architecture that reflects all the known facts about the problem. So the ability and the willingness to regard the problem also from the mathematical and statistical side is a requirement. In the ideal case, the student(s) will be supported to report about their results not only in a thesis, but also in a conference paper. This is an option, but not a stringent requirement.

The active instruction working set of the entire stack can easily reach into multiple megabytes, resulting in frequent front-end stalls due to instruction cache misses and pipeline flushes due to branch target buffer (BTB) misses. A recent study [1] at Google shows that these front-end stalls already account for up to 30% of execution time. In addition, the instruction sets are growing at 25% per year; therefore, the bottleneck is going to be even severe in future. Our recent work, Boomerang, leverages a branch-predictor-directed prefetcher to discover and prefill both the instruction cache blocks and the missing BTB entries. However, the fundamental limitation of Boomerang is that it has to reset (or stop) prefetching on every branch misprediction.

If a sufficient number of such points are tracked between two images, the relative pose (=translation and rotation) of the camera can be estimated. As any measurement in images is afflicted by errors, both these pose estimates as well as the estimated 3D positions of the observed image points are uncertain, and the estimation of the complete camera trajectory as well as the scene model \u201cstitched together\u201d from many views needs to be input data to a huge optimization problem.\nIn AROS, we have access to both real video footage from underwater missions, as well as a realistic simulation environment which is able to generate video sequences where the motion and the 3D geometry are precisely known (\u2018ground truth\u2019).

Which part of the vSLAM development is determined to be the focus area of the student project is subject to negotiation; the intention is to let the students experiment with novel approaches proposed in the recent literature, some of them focusing on geometric models and statistical estimation theory, others on machine learning.

However, the advances in hardware speed and capabilities due to the advancement of Moore's Law that enabled this so-called \"software bloat\" are coming to an end. Accordingly, a movement advocating for lean software has surfaced [1]. This is based on the observations that earlier computers were able to provide a useful working environment including a graphical user interface and networking with far fewer resources. One system demonstrating the possibility of creating such a lean system is Niklaus Wirth's Project Oberon system [2]. Using a self-designed programming language, Oberon, and his own RISC processor implemented on a tiny FPGA, Wirth was able to create a system including a graphical user interface, networking, and a compiler running on a 25 MHz CPU in 1 MB of RAM. The complete system is open source, including the hardware and compiler, the source code for hard- and software can be read by a single person on a rainy weekend. Your task will be to support the analysis if a reduced resource system can also be efficiently implemented using a RISC V CPU core [4]. RISC V is an open source specification that has enabled a large number of implementations ranging from small embedded cores to high-performance 64-bit multicores. The first step enable this is to adapt the Oberon compiler backend to generate RISC V code instead of code for Wirth's RISC machine. In addition, you will extend an open source Project Oberon simulator system [5] to support a RISC V CPU, which will enable you to test your compiler output. Optionally, a hardware implementation on an FPGA based on an open source RISC V core is possible. Useful prerequisites for working on this project are experience with assembler programming and computer architecture, and basics of compilers and code generation. Experience with C/C++ programming (for extending the simulator) or hardware design (for creating the FPGA system) is useful. [1] N.

To facilitate a correct device deployment the relationship between the anatomy and the position of the instruments has to be known and presented to the surgeon. The position of the instruments and the geometry of the vascular tree is best visualized on Xray images, with a wide field of view, however the resulting images are 2D projections of the 3D world for a given a position of the X-ray source. On the other hand the heart\u2019s anatomy is very well depicted using ultrasound images (e.g. 3D transesophageal ultrasound - TEE), however these images have a much smaller field of view due to the positioning of the TEE probe with regards to the heart. Therefore, tools that can automatically identify the position and orientation of the ultrasound probe and cathethers in X-ray images as well as automatic localization of anatomic structures of interest is highly desirable. Today most of these tasks are solved manually or semi-automatically, however automating them would improve the accuracy and also reduce the amount of time the interventionalists spend on aligning the images. We propose three topics for master theses all related to interventional applications of ultrasound imaging. They are:. - AI for ultrasound probe detection in X-ray images, the task will be to identify the location of the ultrasound probe but also its pose  - AI for catheter detection in the ultrasound volume and highlight of it in the image. The goal is to automatically detect catheter, delivery device and artificial devices (like MitraClip or artificial valves). Those objects give somewhat different echo signals but not always very clear nor complete. The task will be to detect automatically such objects within 3D ultrasound datasets. - AI for aortic valve detection in mitral trans esophageal acquisitions of the heart. Previous work supervised by Gabriel Kiss have been focusing on automatically detecting the mitral valve in 3D ultrasound data. This project aims at also detecting the aortic valve. The ultimate goal is automatic detection of anatomical structures running very fast (real-time if possible), so that the 3D data could automatic be presented in a way that makes sense to the physician, by rotating, cropping the 3D data based on the information detected in the images.

We have studied some plugins of IDE that can help to identify vulnerabilities when developers are typing in code. We have also identified the weaknesses of the plugins and the reasons for that. In this project, we want to extend the IDE functions to add the \"autofix\" feature, i.e., recommend autofix suggestions to developers when the vulnerabilities in the code are identified. The tasks will include:. - A literature review of autofix features in bug fixing and vulnerability fixing  - Propose and implement the ideas of autofix features of the plugins - Evaluation of the efficiency and effectiveness of the autofix features The background required for this project includes software security knowledge, compiler technology knowledge, and coding skills.", "Programvaresystemer"], ["Autorettede diagramoppgaver", "Guttorm Sindre", "Valgbart", "Gruppe / En eller flere studenter", "https://www.idi.ntnu.no/education/oppgaveforslag.php?oid=2586", "I mange emner innen data/informatikk skal studentene blant annet l\u00e6re \u00e5 lage modeller, f.eks.

For example, with the enforcement of GDPR all people will be able to get the data that companies such as FGA collect about them and then sell it to smaller companies that may use this data for generating new business models.

However, this approach is questionable for e.g. these reasons: Lack of isolation between in-kernel components results in security problems. Upgrading single components of the system tends to be difficult due to close coupling of the components Lack of isolation between in-kernel components results in security problems Upgrading single components of the system tends to be difficult due to close coupling of the components Liedtke has shown with L4 [1] that building an OS based on a minimal kernel, called microkernel, is not only feasible, but also competitive from a performance point of view. However, functionality built on top of a microkernel still tends to be quite monolithic, such as L4Linux [2]. An improved architecture would, however, use a multi-server system approach, in which each of the services of the OS running on top of the microkernel, such as file systems, memory management, and network protocols, run in a separate process, communicating via IPC (inter-process communication) messages over defined protocols only. microkernel microkernel multi-server multi-server Project topic Project topic In this project, we intend to investigate the challenges involved in re-engineering (i.e. splitting and rearranging) an existing operating system to run as a multi-server system on top of a microkernel. The system to be re-engineered is one of the Plan 9/Inferno family of operating systems [3], which themselves use a (more complex than L4 IPC, but still simple) protocol called 9p [4] to enable interaction between components. A research challenge here would be to enable L4 to also act as a messaging multiplexer for the 9p protocol, which would possibly lead to network transparency of such a multi-server OS. 9p An old monolithic research version of Plan 9 running on the L4 microkernel already exists [5] which could be used as basis for this project or inspiration.

Once the plastic reaches the oceans, it is broken down into smaller particles(micro-plastic) by being exposed to ultra violet (UV) radiation and mechanical abrasion from wave actions [1].The quantity of plastic waste floating at the ocean surface in 2013 was estimated to be approximately 269,000 tonnes (small macro- to micro-plastic), this estimate does not include plastic in-depth or at the seafloor). The plastic debris can affect the wildlife in multiple ways, such as entanglement- entrapping, encircling, or constricting,ingestion- accidental ingestion or ingestion of prey containing plastic, and interaction- being in contact with plastic debris [1].It is therefore important to be able to detect and collect the plastic waste in nature,before it reaches the oceans. Once plastic waste has reaches a micro-stadium, it is near impossible to collect it and remove it from the water. An analysis on deep sea locations(range from 1176 to 4843m) showed that there was an average abundance of 1 micro-plastic per 25cm3(particle sizes ranging from 75 to 161\u03bcm) [2] The AI-task will support the observation and monitoring of plastic items\u200b at consumer side, such as cities, beaches..... We will monitor the geographic distribution of different types of plastic items in these areas. The data will be gathered by citizens in form of taking photos of plastic objects. The photos will be taken using an application on smart phones. The application will have an artificial intelligence (deep learning) algorithm specially tailored for recognition of the material type of the plastic in the photos. The combined information about the geographic distribution, plastic type, and the object type (e.g., bottle, bag) pertinent to plastic debris will be collected in a database which in turn will be statistically analyzed and visualized. The smart application will serve as a tool for empowering citizen science and will contribute to the increase of the awareness and collaboration of citizens towards mitigation of plastic pollution problem.

Slike oppgaver er typisk utformet p\u00e5 den m\u00e5ten at alle kodeliner som trengs for l\u00f8sningen, er gitt - men i omstokket rekkef\u00f8lge - slik at de m\u00e5 trekkes til riktig posisjon for \u00e5 f\u00e5 til en l\u00f8sning. Hvis \u00f8kt vanskegrad er \u00f8nskelig, kan oppgavene ogs\u00e5 inneholde distraktorer, dvs. kodelinjer som ikke skal brukes i l\u00f8sningen. For eksempel p\u00e5 Parsons problems, se f.eks.\u00a0https://www.codio.com/blog/parsons-problems Normalt har slike dra-og-slipp-oppgaver v\u00e6rt ment for \u00e5 l\u00f8ses individuelt. Ideen i dette prosjektet er \u00e5 se p\u00e5 mulige designl\u00f8sninger for \u00e5 f\u00e5 dra-og-slipp-oppgaver til \u00e5 fungere som en gruppeaktivitet, for l\u00e6ring, moro, eller kanskje ogs\u00e5 som et spill med et konkurranseaspekt. Dette vil inneb\u00e6re \u00e5 utvikle en l\u00f8sning hvor flere studenter over nettet kan samarbeide om l\u00f8sningen av slike problemer, f.eks. at 3-4 studenter skal l\u00f8se en slik oppgave sammen. Her kan det tenkes flere ulike varianter, f.eks. med og uten distraktorer som nevnt over. Et annet aspekt som kan variere, er hva studentene f\u00e5r utdelt av informasjon eller puslespillbiter. \"Alle f\u00e5r alt\" \u00a0vil v\u00e6re ett yttterpunkt, her vil alle studentene ha tilgang til alle kodelinjene som er utdelt. Dette har antageligvis noen klare fordeler med at hver deltager har mulighet til \u00e5 f\u00e5 oversikt over hele l\u00f8sningsrommet. Samtidig har det ogs\u00e5 potensielle ulemper. I programmering for nybegynnere kommer studentene inn med h\u00f8yst ulike forutsetninger. Noen har allerede hatt programmering som hobby i \u00e5revis eller har tatt valgfag i lavere utdanning. Andre er helt ferske. \"Alle f\u00e5r alt\" vil inneb\u00e6re at den flinkeste av studentene i en gruppe p\u00e5 3-4, raskt vil kunne skj\u00f8nne hele l\u00f8sningen, uten at de andre blir s\u00e6rlig involvert. Hvis studentene derimot f\u00e5r utdelt ulike puslespillbiter, og hver bare ser de man selv har f\u00e5tt utdelt, er ogs\u00e5 de svakere studentene n\u00f8dt til \u00e5 putte kodelinjer inn p\u00e5 riktig plass i l\u00f8sningsomr\u00e5det for at gruppen skal lykkes - og blir dermed mer aktivt involvert. Dette kan ogs\u00e5 n\u00f8dvendiggj\u00f8re mer kommunikasjon mellom gruppemedlemmene for \u00e5 l\u00f8se oppgaven (\"Hvilke kodelinjer har du?\"; \"Er det noen som har en if-setning?\"), slik at det kanskje ogs\u00e5 kan bli \u00f8velse i kommunikasjon og samarbeid, ikke bare en \u00f8velse i programmering. For eventuell spillifisering kunne man tenke seg at mange grupper a 3-4 studenter konkurrerer med hverandre om \u00e5 l\u00f8se samme oppgave, eksempel med poengscore basert p\u00e5 hvor kjapt man l\u00f8ser oppgaven, men med trekk for eventuelle feilfors\u00f8k slik at det ikke skal l\u00f8nne seg \u00e5 bare kjapt pr\u00f8ve og feile med ulike omstokkinger av koden.

This can be children, or women, or people\nwith disabilities.\nSoftware engineering is the research field which focuses on establishing new knowledge on key factors for the successful\ndevelopment of some of the most complex systems ever developed by humans [1].\nThe current software engineering body of knowledge is challenged by new technological and societal development.\nTechnological developments like Artificial Intelligence, Cloud storage and processing, the Internet of Things, cyberPhysical systems and big data are changing the nature of how software is conceived, developed, and used. At the same,\nsoftware pervades all aspects of society. In today\u2019s digital, automated and globally connected society, software is used\nby larger and larger part of the world population.\nMassive and ever growing amount of software is available today to different people of younger and younger age through\nsites such as Facebook and Instagram, apps, and games. People are increasingly using software intensive technologies.\nIn some cases, the software is specifically made for solving a problem, like helping people with reading difficulties to\nlearn how to read [2] or people with obesity to exercise [3]. In most cases, software is made for commercial purposes.\nIt is getting difficult every day to develop these tools, apps or websites, especially for people with special needs.\nIn previous studies we have addressed creativity software for children [4]; exergames [3]; and software for motivating\nadolescents with Intellectual Disabilities [5] [6] and for increasing empathy[7].\nAn emphasis will be put on studying existing software for inclusion and develop a set of enablers (or characteristics) for\ngood software for inclusion. Ethics, privacy, explanability, cybersecurity, and user well-being will have to be integral\npart of the processes, so that the people who use software systems will be offered new possibilities.\nThe student (or couple of students) will study a sub theme of the theme SE for inclusion, study the literature, plan the\ndevelopment of the software and its evaluation.\nThe student(s) will:\n\u2022 Define a research question.\n\u2022 Run a literature review and identify similar software applications\u00a0\n\u2022 Plan, development and testing of a software application in several iteration - see [8][9]\n\u2022 Document the development and data analysis to propose lesson learnt about software development for inclusion\n\u2022 Paper Writing for Conference (if the student is interested in publishing)  The supervisor will provide the student(s) with Initial Literature and help the student(s) to access to Stakeholders and initial data for the Empirical Investigation If the project will be run as a 15 + 30 project, I expect. that during the Autumn semester the student(s) will implement steps 1 and 2 and during Spring Semester. steps 3,4,5.

The fundamental way of solving the security problem is by building secure software, defending against exploitation from the earliest stages of development, with a consistent maintenance of the \"security-push\" throughout the whole development life-cycle. Today's software development business requires high-speed software delivery from the development team. In order to provide fast delivery of products, organizations have made transformations from their conventional development approach to agile development methods in an attempt to increase the effectiveness of their software development. Agile software development has a huge impact on how software is developed worldwide, and Norway is leading the research in this area, where almost all software companies use agile methods. However, agile projects often focus on immediate business features and functionality over security requirements. There are no security engineering practices developed specifically for the agile processes. Thus, there is little evidence on how to implement security practices in agile software development. Science of Security (SoS) is an area of research that seeks to apply a scientific approach to the study and design of secure and trustworthy information systems. Goals Develop and apply innovative approaches, tools, and techniques for improving security in agile software development in Norway. Empirically understand how software systems can be elicited, designed, built, and maintained to systematically address security issues across an agile development lifecycle. Increase the maturity of the security of software developed in Norway. Foster collaboration within research and practice in order to advance the practice in secure software engineering. Disseminate new knowledge and approach-es to the international research community by publishing in internationally recognized scientific journals and conferences.

The project will explore empirically, model conceptually and test practically new solutions supporting collective intelligence (CI). CI is created when people work together, often with the help of technology, to mobilise a wider range of information, ideas and insights to address a social challenge. The project will start with the creation of an inventory of digital CI tools supporting co-creation. By systematically identifying and describing digital CI tools relevant for the public sector, the purpose of this effort is to establish a database that will be both a usable result of the project and a resource for other project efforts. Both already implemented and new, emerging solutions will be explored. In the first case, the description of these tools will include contextual factors for their implementation and potential indicators of effectiveness. The knowledge generated will thus allow for the identification of enablers or barriers for the use of the associated tools.  The task is based on an operational definition of CI tools and development of a methodology to identify, classify and describe such tools. The task will implement the methodology to systematically describe the selected digital CI tools. It will collect information from: (a) partners\u2019 previous results and knowledge; (b) additional literature review; and (c) data collection with collaborating cities and other public sector organisations from cities\u2019 and partners\u2019 networks.

A common obstacle for industrial companies is that they have data residing in many different systems without common identificators (assets, time series, 3D models, documents, etc). To gain value from digitalization it's important to be able to work across several data sources - e.g. click on something in a 3D and see its sensor time series. Entity matching is the problem of deciding which records from two different data sources refer to the same real-world entity. In this project the student(s) will explore how one can utilize NLP techniques in entity matching when one of the data sources are documents. While typical records only contain short (usually structured) strings, we are sometimes interested in matching with larger documents, for example matching documents describing pieces of equipment. Current entity matching methods does not support this in a good way, and so we need to explore how existing techniques from NLP and/or information retrieval can be integrated. The work will be done on large real-world datasets from Cognite and potentially other open datasets.

The core of Cognite's offering is called Cognite Data Fusion(CDF) and is powered by a labeled property graph concept that enables flexible modeling of industrial information systems for small and larger companies to collaborate in projects and in operations. It is unclear what modeling methodology and modeling language that are most suited to enable both small and big companies to utilize the power of CDF. There is also a need to generate a domain model based on the information model for users and systems to be able to store and navigate the information, and the methodology should take into account how the domain model may change during the course of the project and during the lifetime of the industrial asset. The master project involves evaluating and recommending industrial friendly modeling methodologies, modeling languages and domain model lifecycles and is carried out in close collaboration with Cognite and their customers.\u00a0 The students should expect to spend some time with Cognite in Oslo to understand the technology and the methodological requirements.

Detailed project description. The overall goal of this problem is for Kahoot! to learn more about the content being created on its platform, and use this learning to create a better experience for its users. The majority of user-generated content on the Kahoot!. platform consists of true information being used to teach, engage and learn. By enriching this content, Kahoot! may support its users in several ways, for instance: Detailed project description   Wrong answer suggestions: multiple choices require crafting wrong answers. For instance, with questions like \u201cWhat\u2019s the capital of Norway?\u201d, wrong answers which aren\u2019t too obvious can be Bergen, Trondheim, Stockholm. Bad answers can be apple, sea, dog.

Giving the content creator suggestions on questions or topic areas related to the created quiz can make the learning process more complete for the audience. Unlike the classic Kahoot! live game, Kahoot! challenges are self-paced and are not limited by the users\u2019 location or time. Questions and answers are displayed on the learners\u2019 device and they can complete the challenge at their own pace. When users have finished a challenge, new challenges for the users to take can be recommended, for instance: Topic completion: For instance, a user may have a lot of interest in geography. By analyzing kahoots created in the field of geography, other kahoots needed for the user to become a geography expert can be suggested.. Logical next step: Similarly, we could identify common learning paths and help suggest logical next steps. Topic completion: For instance, a user may have a lot of interest in geography. By analyzing kahoots created in the field of geography, other kahoots needed for the user to become a geography expert can be suggested. Logical next step: Similarly, we could identify common learning paths and help suggest logical next steps. To achieve all of these suggestions, Kahoot! needs a way of extracting information from all kahoots created and combining information with other sources of information using a structured knowledge base, for example Wikipedia. All information may then be stored in a hierarchical knowledge graph to be used by future algorithms or analyses. Named-entity recognition algorithms may subsequently be used to analyze the content. Combining this analysis and the knowledge graph, sophisticated and valuable suggestions and future functionality may be made for the users.

Such an algorithm shall be used to identify the current knowledge of students, allowing thus for formative interventions and identification of gaps in their knowledge. Moreover, such tools are expected to be useful to identify areas in the course that need improvement, and thus provide feedback also to the teacher.

This project is a joint project of Akvaplan-niva AS and NTNU.\n\nProblem description: In recent years, the use of Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) for research and mitigation purposes has dramatically increased, with new studies encouraging its use. Acoustic data provide scientific insights in a broad range of fields including animal vocalizations (biophony) and anthropogenic noise (anthrophony) in the marine environment. Yet, the amount of human effort required to manually identify acoustic features and events rapidly becomes limiting as the size of the data sets increase. Machine learning has the potential to handle large data sets and address many questions in the field of passive acoustic such as automatic detection and classification of sound events. However, the sound from these sources reverberates in the environment which profoundly distorts the original source waveform or can be masked by other sounds overlapping in time and frequencies. Thus the signal recorded usually contains a mixture of highly variable unknown sources, each distorted by the environment in an unknown fashion. Moreover, the noise produced by system events of unmanned autonomous vehicles (gliders) while carrying the hydrophones can saturate the recordings. This issue can mask the detections. Some of the suggested objectives: \u2022 Develop an automatic system able to detect and identify non-biological sound sources. \u2022 Detection of events with time overlap between biotic and abiotic sound sources. \u2022 Develop an algorithm able to automatically identify and filter out the noise events produced by the gliders To achieve the above goals, this project is divided into the following sub-projects: I. Investigate the possibility of applying existing state-of-the-art deep learning methods to solve the above tasks. As part of this, the candidate is expected to perform a state-of-the-art literature review and implement the most relevant method(s) to create automatic detector(s) that can solve the problem. II. Using results from I., the newly developed detector(s) will be compared against manual visual inspection of the data to assess its effectiveness and validate the method(s).

Intermittent computing [1] is the general name of a research area that develops and implements methods to enable software to run on systems with interrupted power supply without having to restart. In the context of this project, you will investigate possibilities of making intermittent computing IoT applications adaptable to varying amounts of available energy using program slicing [2], a compiler technique that splits programs into semantically related subprograms. The idea here is to enable the flexible reduction of a program's functionality depending on the amount of energy available. The maximum energy consumption of program slices can be determined by applying worst-case energy consumption analyses (WCEC) [3]. Using WCEC information obtained at compile time, the runtime (operating system) can then be enabled to execute only important parts of an IoT\u00a0application if insufficient energy is available for executing a complete iteration of the code. Your initial task will be to analyze typical IoT\u00a0benchmark applications as to whether slicing is a useful approach. Based on a selection of useful benchmarks, you will then define slicing criteria and implement slicing analyses and transformations. Depending on the number of students working on the project, additional steps would be to enable WCEC analysis and to extend a simple embedded OS to schedule program slices depending on runtime energy availability. Useful prerequisited for working on this project are experience with C/C++ programming, some background in computer architecture/assembler programming (processor instruction sets and runtime/energy modelling), and ideally compiler/static analysis techniques.

Each student (or couple of students) will study a sub theme of the theme SE and AI, study the literature, plan an empirical investigation to collect data from processes that involve software engineers and software companies. Context:. The rapid diffusion of digital information technologies has created an explosive growth in the amount of digital data. Data is a key asset to compete in today\u2019s business. Digitalization is concerned with using software and data to offer significantly improved products, pure software products as well as digital and data driven services. The intent is to create new revenue opportunities as well as replace traditional business models with new business models. Driving the digital transformation is especially challenging as it brings with it the rapid sequence of three technologies that build on each other, i.e. software, data and artificial intelligence (AI). Although traditionally the focus has been on software, increasingly the latter topics are becoming more important. It is data that allow us to generate insights that are far from obvious to the human mind and to detect patterns in large amounts of data that are elusive otherwise. AI and specially machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), provide technology to identify these patterns in data and then act on these patterns to deliver solutions that were unfeasible before or that function much better with the use of AI.  To be able to handle the challenges of AI engineering, the software development needs to change. The organizations will need to change their business models, as well as business strategy, the architecture of products, systems and services, ways of working, processes and tools as well as organizational structure of the company. The demand for innovation now, calls for a revolutionary mindset that combines skillsets that are not traditionally found in software teams. Software engineering as a critical core capability where best practices are changing rapidly. With the pervasive use and the dependence on AIbased systems, the quality of these systems becomes essential for their practical usage. However, quality assurance for AI-based systems is an emerging area that has not been well explored and requires collaboration between the SE and AI research communities. The objective of this thesis is to understand and create approaches for companies to do quality assurance of AI Based Systems.

The value of sensitive information in computer systems is constantly increasing, and the same can be said for the corresponding threats, but measures to reduce the resulting vulnerabilities are not developed at the same pace. The fundamental way of solving the security problem is by building secure software, defending against exploitation from the earliest stages of development, with a consistent maintenance of the \"security-push\" throughout the whole development life-cycle.

Accordingly, the specific topics will be defined in details together with the interested student(s). Please get in touch with me for further information and/or discussing details. Problem description Problem description Problem description Today,\u00a0IoT devices and the related services are interconnected in the Cloud. This causes a number of problems for users of these devices: Difficulty of data protection and privacy Difficulty of data protection and privacy  Sensitive data from personal IoT devices is stored in Cloud infrastructures today. This includes, e.g., personal health data from fitness trackers and smartwatches, geoloation by all sorts of devices including cars, or room occupancy information provided by smart thermometers. It is unclear who has legitimately (e.g. an insurance company raising your premiums when it induces an \"unhealty\" lifestyle or \"dangerous\" driving from data obtained from your devices) or illegitimately (e.g. burglars using data from your devices to find out when you are not at home) obtained access to your data and what is done with it. A decentralized IoT Cloud would enable the device user to exert\u00a0control over where their data is stored and how it can be used. This can, e.g., be achieved by new operating system and runtime infrastructures built for privacy. This part of the project will investigage these novel structures, based on network-centric operating systems such as Plan 9 and Inferno. Bad sustainability due to forced obsolescence Bad sustainability due to forced obsolescence  The problem of requiring centralized services in the Cloud has an additional implication. Many IoT devices are incapable of working in a standalone mode. This has the consequence that devices turn into e-waste as soon as the related service is no longer available. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that many device manufacturers cease to provide software updates after only a few years - for long-living devices such as washing machines or cares, this can significantly reduce their useful lifetime. In this part of the project, we will provide a system software infrastructure to enable the movement of services for IoT devices from the Cloud to local servers (e.g. a Raspberry Pi home server) and to enable standalone operation of IoT devices - possibly with reduced functionality. This involved using a software platform that allows to move services, e.g. a language-level virtual machine. One of the challenges here is to enable such a system to run on typically resource-constrained IoT hardware systems. Prerequisites Prerequisites Prerequisites Knowledge of system-level programming (e.g. courses on compilers, low-level programming and operating systems) and embedded systems would be a plus. Obviously, experience with software and network infrastructures for the IoT is beneficial. These projects are research-intensive and heavily rely on your interests and ideas to find interesting new solutions - so a high level of motivation for the topic is expected.

A predictable alternative to caches is the use of small, fast and efficient software-managed on-chip memories, so-called scratchpad memories (SPMs) or tightly-couple memories (TCMs) [1]. Like caches, these memories are used to store commonly accessed code and data. In contrast to caches, the contents of SPMs are defined by software. This allows a SPM content management algorithm to copy relevant contents from and to main memory as required. SPM management also allows to implement additional features. For example, data in main memory can be compressed or encrypted on demand. Another possible feature would be to implement selective redundancy by storing data in main memory using software-based ECC codes [2] or other methods of redundancy to protect data against main memory errors. Your task will be to design and implement a framework for SPM data management that is able to execute this additional functionality on demand, e.g. as defined by static compiler analyses. The platform will be a typical high-end microcontroller system, e.g. ARM Cortex-M7/M33 or RISC V-based. Interesting challenges in this project will be to handle changing addresses for statically (global) as well as dynamically allocated (stack) data [3] and to ensure data consistency when data is moved between main memory and the SPM while a program runs. Useful prerequisites for working on this project are experience with C/C++ programming, some background in computer architecture/assembler programming, and basics of compilers. Embedded systems experience and experience with open-source compiler toolchains (clang/LLVM) is not required but would be beneficial. [1] R. Banakar, S. Steinke, Bo-Sik Lee, M. Balakrishnan and P.

Context: The rapid diffusion of digital information technologies has created an explosive growth in the amount of digital data. Data is a key asset to compete in today\u2019s business. Digitalization is concerned with using software and data to offer significantly improved products, pure software products as well as digital and data driven services. The intent is to create new revenue opportunities as well as replace traditional business models with new business models. Driving the digital transformation is especially challenging as it brings with it the rapid sequence of three technologies that build on each other, i.e. software, data and artificial intelligence (AI). Although traditionally the focus has been on software, increasingly the latter topics are becoming more important. It is data that allow us to generate insights that are far from obvious to the human mind and to detect patterns in large amounts of data that are elusive otherwise. AI and specially machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), provide technology to identify these patterns in data and then act on these patterns to deliver solutions that were unfeasible before or that function much better with the use of AI. To be able to handle the challenges of AI engineering, the software development needs to change. The organizations will need to change their business models, as well as business strategy, the architecture of products, systems and services, ways of working, processes and tools as well as organizational structure of the company. The demand for innovation now, calls for a revolutionary mindset that combines skillsets that are not traditionally found in software teams. Software engineering as a critical core capability where best practices are changing rapidly. Because the work practice around building and integrating machine learning into software and services is still emerging and is not uniform across all product teams, there is no systematic way to identify the key stakeholders on the topic of adoption. The way organizations structure the teams to work with AI Engineering is a challenge, first because it is not a \u201ctraditional\u201d way of developing software and second, there is a shortage of data analytics in the market, and it is not clear yet what is the demand of workload that will be needed for each software team. There is also little knowledge on  how to effectively have the different roles working together, we have to find ways that the data analysts works together with the software development teams and vice versa. To gain value from data analytics inside software development teams requires a strong data science skillset and there simply aren\u2019t that many people around that have this skillset. Training existing staff to become proficient in data science skills is quite challenging and most certainly harder than providing machine learning education to engineers and developers. Many in the industry believe that artificial intelligence applications, and especially machine and deep-learning models, suffer from the same challenges.

My side of the project involves the fundamental software infrastructure as well as new approaches for programming autonomous mobile robots. Details Details Modern robots no longer rely on a centralized processor, but use a complex, heterogeneous distributed networked system. This project will be a part of our project to construct the hard- and software for such a mobile, autonomous robot. Nodes in the robot system will include high-performance systems such as NVidia Jetson for image processing, coordinating nodes such as Raspberry Pis, as well as small-scale embedded microcontrollers such as Arm Cortex-M for controlling simple sensors and actuators. In this part of the projects, there are two major challenges: Creating a communication infrastructure to interconnect all devices. This includes problems such as persistency of communication (due to energy preservation modes for some devices) and also real-time synchronization (to enable sensor fusion for autonomous devices, e.g. combining camera, Lidar and ultrasonic data).. Enabling the robot end user to program the robot without requiring knowledge about C programming, networking or distributed systems. This part of the project involves mapping the distributed system to a graphical representation, e.g. StateCharts, so abstract solutions to autonomous robotics projects can be easily developed. You might have seen something similar for Lego MindStorms systems (this is based on LabView) - we intend to use this idea to enable the simple programming of a complex autonomous robot.

This is an umbrella project that can result in of a number of subtopics for specific projects. Accordingly, the specific topics will be defined in details together with the interested student(s). Please get in touch with me for further information and/or discussing details. Prerequisites Prerequisites Prerequisites Knowledge of system-level programming (e.g. courses on compilers, low-level programming and operating systems) and embedded systems would be a plus. Obviously, experience with software and communication infrastructures for embedded systems is beneficial. These projects are research-intensive and heavily rely on your interests and ideas to find interesting new solutions - so a high level of motivation for the topic is expected.

Each student (or couple of students) will study a sub theme of the theme SE and children, study the literature, plan an empirical investigation to collect data from processes that involve software engineers. Context: . Massive and ever growing amount of software is available today to children of younger and younger age through sites such as Facebook and Instagram, apps, and games. Children are increasingly using software intensive technologies. In some cases, the software is specifically made for solving a problem, like helping children with reading difficulties to learn how to read [5] or children with obesity to exercise [3]. In other cases, the software is made to enhance children creativity [8], like Scratch [10]. In most cases, software is made for commercial purposes and for entertaining children, like Callof Duty.  It is harder and hard to keep up with threats and vulnerabilities associated with these tools, apps or websites, especially for children. In the recent years we have assisted to a series of problems generated by the use of software by children. Children can fall victim to cyber security threats like social engineering, cyber bullying, hacking, viruses, and damaging malware, cyber stalking, etc. through search engines, online advertisements and social networking websites such as Facebook, Twitter and lots of other websites [4]. Mental health issues and even suicide are been caused by interaction with software. Instagram removed nearly 10,000 images related to suicide and self harm every day in the months following the Molly Russell scandal (according to https://www.telegraph.co.uk). Physical health issues, like obesity [12] and diabetes are been caused by use of videogames. Given the greater exposure of children to these technologies, the design research community takes into account children\u2019s abilities, interests, and developmental needs [6] when designing interfaces of software for children. In previous studies we have addressed creativity software for children [9]; exergames [3]; and software for motivating adolescents with Intellectual Disabilities [7]. As far as our knowledge, a categorization of software for children which balance creativity, security, and the various dimensions of child well-being (physical, mental, and social) have not been proposed. Ethics, privacy, explanability, cybersecurity, and children well-being will have to be integral part of the processes, so that the children who use software systems will be offered new possibilities and made aware of threads.  An emphasis will be put on studying existing software practices in software companies that develop software that are used by children and develop a set of enablers(or characteristics) for good software security for children. The student(s) will: Run a literature review Plan and Run an empirical investigation (data collection, data analysis) with software engineers as subjects Propose a solution to a problem as an artefact Paper Writing for Conference, like ICSE Society Track The supervisor will provide the student(s) with Initial Literature and help the student(s) to access to Stakeholders and initial data for the Empirical Investigation . If the project will be run as a 15 + 30 project, I expect that during the Autumn semester the student(s) will implement steps 1 and 2 and during Spring Semester steps 3,4,5. . The supervisor wish to interact with the master students and organize workshops and supervision sessions weekly.   References . [1] S. Easterbrook, J. Singer, M.-A. Storey, and D. Damian.

B\u00f8ndene slipper sauene ut p\u00e5 fritt beite rundt midten av mai og sanker de inn igjen fra september og til sn\u00f8en legger seg. I denne tiden g\u00e5r sauen fritt i skog og fjell med tilsyn i prinsippet en gang i uka. Sanking av sauene om h\u00f8sten er en flertrinnsoperasjon som normalt tar et antall uker. Man g\u00e5r oftest gjennom et par runder per hovedbeiteomr\u00e5de hvor de aller fleste sauene lokaliseres og drives hjem til g\u00e5rden. Dernest f\u00f8lger en fase hvor de siste skal lokaliseres og bringes hjem. Denne siste fasen er oftest langvarig og arbeidskrevende da man ofte ikke har noen god formening om hvor sauene befinner seg. Systemet vi skal utvikle har prim\u00e6rt til hensikt \u00e5 effektivisere lokaliseringen av disse siste sauene slik at sauebonden kan spare det meste av det sv\u00e6rt tidkrevende s\u00f8kearbeidet.

Radioen skal sende ut et \u00abping\u00bb med jevne mellomrom som kan fanges opp av en drone. . Man benytter en flydrone til \u00e5 s\u00f8ke etter sauene over et stort areal. N\u00e5r flydronen mottar et signal fra en eller flere sauer, registrerer den sin egen GPS-posisjon. Vi vet da et sauen befinner seg innenfor en radius av 300 til 500 meter i forhold til dronens posisjon. Det vil ogs\u00e5 v\u00e6re mulig \u00e5 m\u00e5le avstanden til sauen ved \u00e5 g\u00e5 over i s\u00e5kalt \u00abranging-modus\u00bb s\u00e5 snart en har mottatt signal fra sauen.

Software systems have developed to the point that we use and depend upon them daily in the same way that we depend upon traditional infrastructures and utilities. The value of sensitive information in computer systems is constantly increasing, and the same can be said for the corresponding threats, but measures to reduce the resulting vulnerabilities are not developed at the same pace. The fundamental way of solving the security problem is by building secure software, defending against exploitation from the earliest stages of development, with a consistent maintenance of the \"security-push\" throughout the whole development life-cycle. Today's software development business requires high-speed software delivery from the development team. In order to provide fast delivery of products, organizations have made transformations from their conventional development approach to agile development methods in an attempt to increase the effectiveness of their software development. Agile software development has a huge impact on how software is developed worldwide, and Norway is leading the research in this area, where almost all software companies use agile methods. However, agile projects often focus on immediate business features and functionality over security requirements. There are no security engineering practices developed specifically for the agile processes. Thus, there is little evidence on how to implement security practices in agile software development. Science of Security (SoS) is an area of research that seeks to apply a scientific approach to the study and design of secure and trustworthy information systems. Goals Develop and apply innovative approaches, tools, and techniques for improving security in agile software development in Norway. Empirically understand how software systems can be elicited, designed, built, and maintained to systematically address security issues across an agile development lifecycle. Increase the maturity of the security of software developed in Norway. Foster collaboration within research and practice in order to advance the practice in secure software engineering. Disseminate new knowledge and approach-es to the international research community by publishing in internationally recognized scientific journals and conferences.

Each student (or couple of students) will study a sub theme of the theme SE and children, study the literature, plan an empirical investigation to collect data from processes that involve children, software and possibly software engineers. Context: . Massive and ever growing amount of software is available today to children of younger and younger age through sites such as Facebook and Instagram, apps, and games. Children are increasingly using software intensive technologies. In some cases, the software is specifically made for solving a problem, like helping children with reading difficulties to learn how to read [5] or children with obesity to exercise [3]. In other cases, the software is made to enhance children creativity [8], like Scratch [10]. In most cases, software is made for commercial purposes and for entertaining children, like Callof Duty.. It is getting difficult every day to keep up with threats and vulnerabilities associated with these tools, apps or websites, especially for children. In the recent years we have assisted to a series of problems generated by the use of software by children. These problems arise from the use of both general software like Facebook and Instagram and specific software for children. Children can fall victim to cyber security threats like social engineering, cyber bullying, hacking, viruses, and damaging malware, cyber stalking, etc. through search engines, online advertisements and social networking websites such as Facebook, Twitter and lots of other websites [4]. Mental health issues and even suicide are been caused by interaction with software. Instagram removed nearly 10,000 images related to suicide and self harm every day in the months following the Molly Russell scandal(according to https://www.telegraph.co.uk). Physical health issues, like obesity [12] and diabetes are been caused by use of videogames.. Given the greater exposure of children to these technologies, the design research community takes into account children\u2019s abilities, interests, and developmental needs [6] when designing interfaces of software for children. In previous studies we have addressed creativity software for children [9]; exergames [3]; and software for motivating adolescents with Intellectual Disabilities [7]. As far as our knowledge, a categorization of software for children which balance creativity, security, and the various dimensions of child well-being (physical, mental, and social) have not been proposed. An emphasis will be put on studying existing software for children and develop a set of enablers(or characteristics) for good software for children. Ethics, privacy, explanability, cybersecurity, and children well-being will have to be integral part of the processes, so that the children who use software systems will be offered new possibilities and made aware of threads.    The student(s) will:. Run a systematic literature review and prepare a paper for journal. Plan an empirical investigation. Run an empirical investigation (data collection, data analysis) with children and/or software engineers as subjects. Propose Software Engineering Process with children as stakeholders . Paper Writing for Conference, like ICSE Society Track      The supervisor will provide the student(s) with Initial Literature and help the student(s) to access to Stakeholders and initial data for the Empirical Investigation. If the project will be run as a 15 + 30 project, I expect that during the Autumn semester the student(s) will implement steps 1 and 2 and during Spring Semester steps 3,4,5.. The supervisor wish to interact with the master students and organize workshops and supervision sessions weekly.   References. [1] S. Easterbrook, J. Singer, M.-A. Storey, and D. Damian.

In this project we will investigate how the use of Virtual, Augmented and Extended Reality (VR/AR/XR) technologies and gaming elements can 1) motivate and inform young job seekers on their way to work and 2) contribute to faster skill acquisition for new employees. The virtual experience will allow the users to train in unfamiliar situations (job interview, typical tasks at different workplaces, interaction with others) in a safe setting, thus mastering the corresponding real world situation. Through the simulation of a workplace or an industry (e.g. aquaculture, car workshop or pharmacy), the job seekers can immerse into different workplaces and try out typical tasks, for example, salmon feeding or administering a COVID-19 vaccine.\nThis master thesis will focus on design principles and tools for developing and evaluating workplace training in VR/AR/XR, in connection with the ongoing project financed by NAV (Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration), https://www.ntnu.edu/imtel/virtual-internship. The project has so far resulted in several prototypes for workplace training and job interview training in VR and received international recognition (e.g. Best Demo Award at EuroVR 2018 and Breakthrough Auggie Award finalist) and broad media coverage https://memu.no/artikler/gir-ungdom-en-virtuell-jobbsmak/.

To facilitate a correct device deployment the relationship between the anatomy and the position of the instruments has to be known and presented to the surgeon. The position of the instruments and the geometry of the vascular tree is best visualized on Xray images, with a wide field of view, however the resulting images are 2D projections of the 3D world for a given a position of the X-ray source. On the other hand the heart\u2019s anatomy is very well depicted using ultrasound images (e.g. 3D transesophageal ultrasound - TEE), however these images have a much smaller field of view due to the positioning of the TEE probe with regards to the heart. Therefore, tools that can automatically identify the position and orientation of the ultrasound probe and cathethers in X-ray images as well as automatic localization of anatomic structures of interest is highly desirable. Today most of these tasks are solved manually or semi-automatically, however automating them would improve the accuracy and also reduce the amount of time the interventionalists spend on aligning the images. We propose three topics for master theses all related to interventional applications of ultrasound imaging. They are:. - AI for ultrasound probe detection in X-ray images, the task will be to identify the location of the ultrasound probe but also its pose  - AI for catheter detection in the ultrasound volume and highlight of it in the image. The goal is to automatically detect catheter, delivery device and artificial devices (like MitraClip or artificial valves). Those objects give somewhat different echo signals but not always very clear nor complete. The task will be to detect automatically such objects within 3D ultrasound datasets. - AI for aortic valve detection in mitral trans esophageal acquisitions of the heart. Previous work supervised by Gabriel Kiss have been focusing on automatically detecting the mitral valve in 3D ultrasound data. This project aims at also detecting the aortic valve. The ultimate goal is automatic detection of anatomical structures running very fast (real-time if possible), so that the 3D data could automatic be presented in a way that makes sense to the physician, by rotating, cropping the 3D data based on the information detected in the images.

The functional consequences of early brain injury in newborns are commonly seen months or even years after birth, delaying therapeutic interventions and leaving families with uncertainty about their child\u2019s health status for months and years. Classification of movement characteristics and movement patterns in spontaneous movements in young infants has in recent years been presented as the most accurate method for early identification of infants who will later develop serious motor problems and reduced motor function (like cerebral palsy). Today, characteristic of such normal and abnormal infant spontaneous movement could be objectively captured and processed by computer software from video recordings but the procedures are so far too imprecise, cumbersome and time consuming for clinical use (see here for more information).  here Based on a database of 1400 video recordings at St. Olav\u2019s University Hospital of infants at risk of neurological dysfunctions from multiple sites worldwide, in particular Norway, USA and India, this student assignment aims at solving the following tasks: To identify risk-related movement patterns in video predicting later outcome of motor disabilities..

Today data-monopolies like Facebook, Google, Amazon (FGA)  etc. are relying most of their business on the data they collect about people, and this without paying for this data. In the near future, people will conceive  information/data as \u201ccommodity\u201d, i.e., something that can be sold and bought. For example, with the enforcement of GDPR all people will be able to get the data that companies such as FGA collect about them and then sell it to smaller companies that may use this data for generating new business models. The topic of this thesis is to develop further the blockchain-based data marketplace that enables data selling and buying while resolving trust and privacy problems. The Data Marketplace uses Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts to allow peers to communicate about the conditions of data sharing and perform the data exchange itself.

Supervised learning requires data instances annotated with the correct output labels, but the other paradigms assume no such labelled data. Reinforcement learning is primarily concerned with what actions an intelligent agent (or group of agents) should take in a specified environment in order to maximise some cumulative reward, while simultaneously exploring the environment and exploiting previously accumulated knowledge. The environment is commonly formulated as a Markov decision process or as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), depending on whether the agent can observe the current environmental state directly or whether the observed states are distorted by noise. Reinforcement learning agents have shown strong performance on classical games, making this an interesting approach to test in general in the context of computational creativity. However, a creative \u201cgame\u201d type setting using the standard Monte Carlo algorithm can be a time-consuming process. An alternative can then be to utilise strategies that combine ideas from neural network type set-ups with evolutionary approaches (e.g., compositional pattern-producing networks; Stanley 2007) or model-free reinforcement learning such as Q-learning (or deep Q-learning as introduced by Google DeepMind; Mnih et al. 2015, Silver et al. 2018), which only learns the value of an action in a particular state (stochastic transitions and rewards), without having a model of the environment.

The AI department at Tr\u00f8nderEnergi is currently developing a \u201cblack box\u201d monitoring system that will incorporate real-time measurements of working conditions (e.g., temperature, weather, etc). The goal is to avoid unplanned shut-downs through maintenance plans that fix or replace deteriorated parts at opportune times (e.g., when the production is low due to lack of wind).\n\nProblem description\nThe black-box system for maintenance planning is central in Tr\u00f8nderEnergi\u2019s operation of the wind-mill parks.

We are the largest medical laboratory in Norway and our main office is located at Furuset, Oslo. Our main objective is to provide our clients, mainly general practitioners in the primary healthcare and their patients, with fast and accurate analysis of medical tests along with expert advice and interpretation. F\u00fcrst employs some 400 people, most of whom are bioengineers and 17 medical doctors within the various laboratory disciplines. Our IT-Department consists of about 30 software and computer engineers and is responsible for developing the client facing requisitioning software and the laboratory information system. The thesis will be carried out within the Analytics unit in the IT Department under the supervision and guidance of our two senior data scientists, both of whom have extensive experience in the industry and academia. Problem description Problem description Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods have the potential to improve healthcare and enhance medical knowledge by empowering clinicians and practitioners with new and useful insights that are otherwise unavailable.. A major obstacle to harnessing this potential is the unavailability of high-quality data. National and EU regulations as well as legitimate privacy concerns hamper the direct use of electronic health records and clinical trial results for research and explorative purposes. Approaches based on data anonymization are usually applied to overcome this problem and preserve data privacy. However, these strategies are often based on techniques which take out a substantial share of data and/or data features, resulting in an overall loss of potentially valuable information. Furthermore, real data \u2013 especially in a medical/healthcare context \u2013 suffer from (or are characterised by) unavoidable flaws such as small dataset sizes, class imbalance, noise, all of which complicates and slows down the implementation and testing of ML models.. Synthetic data generation (SDG) represents the ideal solution to this conundrum. Broadly speaking the term synthetic data refers to the generation of artificial data which exhibit the same statistical properties and underlying structures of an original dataset. The generation of reliable synthetic data could help ML practitioners in the healthcare sector to quickly test data analytics and ML strategies, while preserving data privacy without relying on methods vulnerable to waste of useful data. Moreover, synthetic data, stripped of sensitive and private information, can be openly published and shared, thus facilitating a virtuous circle of research and dissemination.   Thesis description Thesis description The focus of this master thesis project is the selection and implementation of ML/DL algorithms for the generation of high-quality synthetic patient records based on real patient records collected and stored by. F\u00fcrst. Electronic patient records often include multiple biomarkers, and thus the generated synthetic data should reproduce the statistical properties of high-dimensional and complex distributions, which might also vary in time in case of patient records tracking the evolution of a particular biomarker over time. This is a challenging and fascinating scientific question, which can be tackled with cutting edge deep learning methods. We propose to explore a framework based on (the application of) generative adversarial networks. (GAN), which have been successfully used in other contexts including synthetic generation of images.. The outline of the project is the following:    Literature review on the state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning methods for SDR.. Selection and implementation of the most relevant method(s) for the generation of synthetic\u00a0patient records, in collaboration with the Analytics unit at F\u00fcrst..

A study to determine the quality of the generated data, especially to make sure that it is not too\u00a0close to the real data. Data Data The data will be structured, numerical biochemical data (blood values). Exactly which biomarkers should be used in this thesis is yet to be determined, but it will easily be in the millions of rows, going back decades. The data will be de-identified and minimally preprocessed, but due to the sensitivity of the data and lack of agreed upon strategies for ensured anonymisation, certain features should only be accessed and manipulated in F\u00fcrst internal servers. Only the synthetic data and the models created during the work in this thesis should be made publicly available. We will also ask that a confidentiality agreement be signed as part of our internal data protection and privacy measures. Challenges. While there are no specific financial or business-related concerns to sharing data, we must always ensure that the data is properly anonymised and protected and that we are always operating within GDPR and Norwegian laws. As such, prior to starting the thesis work, F\u00fcrst will seek approval for the project to the Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REC) and perform a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). Aside from the practical challenges and formalities, there are also some interesting issues related to generating synthetic data of too high a quality. Literature suggests that there is a point where the data generation might become too good and too close to the original data leading to potential problems with respect to the re-identification of the original patient records.

However, in order to be able, evaluate, choose and design the right equipment for the riders, accurate race predictions are needed.. While some factors can be estimated with physical models (gravity, power production, air resistance to mention a few), some other factors are complex to estimate and they are often rider dependent (braking, ability to ride in the curves) or weather dependent (temperature, humidity, weather) or even dependent on the physiological shape of the rider (peak training, end season, etc.).. In particular, one of the models currently developed produces good results in the straight and flat parts of the course but fails to estimate the rider\u2019s velocity in the downhill parts.   While the trends are well captured, further work is needed in order to correctly predict the riders performances with the ultimate goal of delivering rider-tuned model. With Team INEOS being always in the forefront when gathering marginal gains, the attention towards machine learning approaches which would lead towards rider-specific time trial simulators is very high. Main tasks. The present work will then be targeted towards a product that can better estimate the performances of each rider, learning from simulated time trials and training data gathered by the athletes during the training season and from time trials executed during races.. The project will consist of two phases:. Develop a fully data driven simulator and compare it with the deterministic model currently used by the team. Develop a hybrid model where the predictions of the deterministic model currently used by the team are improved by a data-driven add-on. Team INEOS will have the provide the anonymized data needed for the development of the model and will follow the development having an active role.

Refinitiv Research&Forecast With the extreme increase in renewables in Europe it is becoming increasingly important to identify in advance possible weather conditions which might lead to wind power curtailment. Curtailment of power is a common phenomenon in wind farms. It simply means that the wind turbine is made to operate at a capacity lower than it should at a certain wind speed. This can be forced for safety reasons by the plant owners, or for grid congestion reasons by the system operators. Developing algorithms for anticipating such curtailment is of crucial importance both for the system operators and for the traders, since it will lead to more precise wind power forecasts, and as a consequence to better decisions.

CFD is today used in a wide range of industries, some\u00a0examples are: \u25cf air resistance for airplanes and cars. \u25cf wind and wave loads on buildings and marine structures. \u25cf heat- and mass transfer in chemical processing plants    These simulations can provide a detailed understanding of the fluid flow, but the simulations\u00a0are complex and computationally costly. This currently makes processes like generative\u00a0design and optimization complex and interactive design impossible.  With the rapid improvement of machine learning algorithms, it has been proven possible to\u00a0train neural networks to reproduce the pressure on a surface from CFD simulations. In\u00a0collaboration with students from NTNU, Nabla Flow successfully carried out an initial proof of\u00a0concept where generative adversarial networks (GANs) were trained with CFD simulations\u00a0to predict the airflow around buildings in an urban environment. This outcome could\u00a0eventually allow architects, urban planners, and engineers to interact with the urban\u00a0environment, designing spaces with improved pedestrian comfort. These students\u00a0formulated the problem of producing CFD simulations as an image-to-image problem, using GANs like Pix2Pix and CycleGAN, with the extension of adding positional\u00a0encodings to the conditional input. With an appropriate training procedure and a fitting type of neural network, we believe the\u00a0pressure field on surfaces can be estimated in real-time. We think further work should be\u00a0done with either GANs or Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where we move from this being a\u00a0translation problem between flat 2D images to condition on a 2D surface in the form of a\u00a0surface triangulation. Deepmind showed in some of their latest work how they learned to\u00a0simulate complex physics with graph networks [1] in various physical domains like fluid\u00a0dynamics. Simultaneously, the experiments in [2] demonstrate that convolutional neural. networks can work as a surrogate model for physical solvers both when given discrete 2D\u00a0and 3D bluff shapes.

Among those are naval architecture, hydrodynamics, marine cybernetics, aquaculture, underwater robotics, new marine resources, and offshore energy production. The organisation has developed and acquired recognised competence and technology in underwater robotics, control systems technology, autonomy, remote sensing, data acquisition, signal processing and underwater machine vision.

About the company  Problem description\u00a0. Real-time estimation and prediction of sea current conditions at fish farms is key to make autonomous operations in aquaculture possible, on and below the surface. Autonomous marine vehicles must prove functional in harsh weather and therefore require precise spatial and temporal current estimations to accomplish the assigned tasks. Spatial and temporal estimation of sea current at fish farms is, per today, done via hydrodynamic models that run offline and that require significant computational power, and are therefore unsuited to real-time applications. Problem description  Thesis description. The thesis will apply machine learning (ML) to estimate and predict sea current conditions at fishfarms in real-time, with high spatial and temporal precision. The thesis will generate physics-informed deep learning (DL) models with inductive biases from classical physical models derived from the fields of dynamics and hydrodynamics. This will establish a solid and strong foundation for real time application of DL models, where such trained models will generate accurate outputs within a time frame that is comparable with the operation schedule.

The thesis will be carried out in collaboration with the Analytics and AI team at Telenor Research, a research department inside Telenor which focuses on developing high level models for solving complex Telco use cases and performing state-of-the-art research within AI. Problem description. Anomaly detection is an important area of research in Machine Learning and has a lot of important applications in real case scenarios. In the Telco domain, efficient and accurate Anomaly Detection is vital to be able to continuously monitor the base station\u2019s key metrics and alert for possible incidents in time. With the constant upgrades in the Network infrastructure there is a need for creating more precise models that can automate such detection. Most commonly, the anomalies to be detected do not come from single counters but from systems recording several counters, that is, generating multivariate time series. The difficulty in individuating anomalies in multivariate time series arises from the fact that the contexts and correlations between the different features and time windows have to be taken into account and examined. Baseline probabilistic models (such as Gaussian mixture models) are used today, but they are unable to detect the interesting anomalous behaviour that occurs. Moreover, static non data-driven thresholds are used to infer whether a signal is abnormal or not, completely ignoring the context and traffic patterns. Problem description  Thesis description. There are two main types of anomalies that are desirable to detect: 1) point anomalies and 2) trend anomalies. The latter, corresponding to failures in the Network, are especially hard to recognise, as they do not differ much from the \u201cnormal\u201d situation, so one has to leverage on the correlations between the time series components and also use the topological information on the location of the base stations, in order to discover them. In this thesis, the student(s) will explore the capabilities of Deep models such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and/or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for the task of anomaly detection. In particular the student(s) will:. - Explore the state of the art in use of Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection for both the univariate and the multivariate case. - Define the limitations of the current SoTA methods. - Implement a set of strong baselines. - Propose one++ GNN/GAN based solution for Anomaly Detection on Telco data, leveraging on the correlations between the multivariate time series components and spatial correlations between the neighbouring base stations.

Most of the 3D FER state-of-the-art methods extract hand-crafted features [1-5], which could be considered as a digital signature of the face, and use them in order to compare different 3D faces through trained classifiers or similarity functions [6]. . The rise of deep learning networks tends to replace the hand-crafted features with features automatically extracted by the deep networks. Nonetheless, deep networks require large training datasets in order to converge and produce reliable results.. Up until recently, deep networks could not be sufficiently implemented in the case of 3D FER for two reasons: 1) lack of existence of large labelled 3D face datasets for training and 2) deep networks could not consume 3D data (3D meshes, point clouds etc.) as input.. The 1st issue has been solved with the improvement of the 3D data acquisition hardware. More and more 3D face datasets are produced [7-9], along with software capable of producing synthetic 3D face models [10], which can further augment the real data within a deep training process.. For resolving the 2nd issue, initially, the methodologies converted the actual 3D data into a 2D modality like depth images or geometry images [11, 12]. Thus making the data compatible with the existing deep networks. This is expected to change in the near future, due to the newest machine learning trend, the so-called Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) [13,14]. GDL introduces deep networks that can be fed with 3D meshes, point clouds and graphs. Thus, GDL models are very interesting to be studied in order to find out whether they can achieve a performance boost in terms of 3D FER evaluation measures, as they have already done in other computer vision applications.. Additionally, and depending on the progress, more applications of the system will be examined i.e. 3D Facial Expressions Recognition or 3D Facial Micro-expressions Detection.      ======================.

When building object detectors for marine applications, it is particularly important to have training sets which do not only contain a sufficient number of relevant object classes (ships, piers, buoys, ...), but also show the different variations in lighting conditions, and weather conditions (fog, rain, snow, ...). As it is difficult, if practically possible at all, to record a sufficient number of such images or videos for training object detector networks, this project aims at artificially generating these variations of image conditions, in particular different illumination and strongly different weather conditions.\nImage augmentation is a well-known technique for synthetically expanding limited or imbalanced training datasets used in computer vision tasks to improve generalization performance and to avoid overfitting. Likewise, augmentations can be used for testing network generalization performance, by imposing varying augmentations, e.g. two-dimensional augmentations such as shifts, rotations, etc., as well as natural phenomena, e.g. snow, fog, lighting conditions, etc., or even adding synthetic objects to the scene. The former is straightforward using simple transformations in two dimensions, whereas the latter should imitate realistic, and highly stochastic, scenarios that in reality depends on the depth information of the scene. Nonetheless, this is often done by basic image manipulations imposed uniformly over the whole scene without considering depth information and may result in unrealistic augmentations not representing reality and could possibly produce erroneous testing performance. As an example, fog or rain may be observed only at a certain distance and/or area and affects only specific far-away objects, rather than all objects in the scene. The proposed research topic is therefore to investigate techniques for extracting depth information from images or video and taking advantage of this information to apply augmentations of natural phenomena in 3-Dimensions.\nFor the extraction of this 3D information, one can use recent methods of single image depth estimation by deep neural networks, or \"motion stereo\" from a moving camera (in case of video sequences). Both approaches can also be combined.\nTherefore, the first partial goal of this project is to explore methods for depth estimation for given training images or videos.\nThe second goal is to use the extracted estimate of the depth structure to simulate the desired weather and illumination situation, such as fog, rain, or snow. Again, this can be done by \"classical\" physics-based computer graphics modeling, and/or by suitably trained deeep neural networks.\nAnother important aspect is to benchmark 2D and 3D synthetic augmentations against images containing actual natural phenomena\u2019s, i.e. network performance on synthetic scenes against true scenes.\nThis project will be performed with the Norwegian company DNV GL which is interested in quality assurance of marine detection systems, and will also be related to the marine multi-sensro simulator project currently pursued at NTNU.\nStudents who are interested in this project are advised to address Prof. Rudolf Mester at IDI for more details.

By the term 3D-to-2D Face Recognition (3D-2D FR) we refer to the procedure of face recognition using as input a typical 2D facial image query (or a sequence of 2D facial images of the same identity) against a dataset containing 3D facial models (i.e., facial meshes or point clouds).\u00a0. To the best of our knowledge, most of the 3D-2D FR state-of-the-art methods do not use deep learning procedures [1,2]. Thus, as a proposed approach, classical deep learning networks [3], able to extract meaningful features from sequences of 2D face images, as well as modern geometric deep networks [4], able to extract meaningful features from 3D facial models, could be combined, using appropriate loss functions [6], in the form of the so-called Siamese Networks [5].. The training of such a network could be performed by using synthetic data to be generated by the FaceGen [7] tool that is available at the Visual Computing Lab.   ======================.

The focus of the thesis is to use artificial intelligence (AI) and multimodal data (MMD) to understand and support children\u2019s learning experiences through a carefully designed dashboard and data driven feedback mechanisms. MMD is derived from eyetracker, wrist band, and motion sensor (i.e., skeletal tracking). The dashboard provides the educational facilitator (i.e., instructor or parent) with a real-time visualisation of the learners cognitive, affective and physiological state based on the collected MMD. AI components will produce feedback mechanisms, which may be delivered directly to the learner, or to their educational facilitator.  Thesis Description. In a first step, the student needs to review the literature and familiarize themself with multimodal dashboard system.

To facilitate a correct device deployment the relationship between the anatomy and the position of the instruments has to be known and presented to the surgeon. The position of the instruments and the geometry of the vascular tree is best visualized on Xray images, with a wide field of view, however the resulting images are 2D projections of the 3D world for a given a position of the X-ray source. On the other hand the heart\u2019s anatomy is very well depicted using ultrasound images (e.g. 3D transesophageal ultrasound - TEE), however these images have a much smaller field of view due to the positioning of the TEE probe with regards to the heart. Therefore, tools that can automatically identify the position and orientation of the ultrasound probe and cathethers in X-ray images as well as automatic localization of anatomic structures of interest is highly desirable. Today most of these tasks are solved manually or semi-automatically, however automating them would improve the accuracy and also reduce the amount of time the interventionalists spend on aligning the images. We propose three topics for master theses all related to interventional applications of ultrasound imaging. They are:. - AI for ultrasound probe detection in X-ray images, the task will be to identify the location of the ultrasound probe but also its pose  - AI for catheter detection in the ultrasound volume and highlight of it in the image. The goal is to automatically detect catheter, delivery device and artificial devices (like MitraClip or artificial valves). Those objects give somewhat different echo signals but not always very clear nor complete. The task will be to detect automatically such objects within 3D ultrasound datasets. - AI for aortic valve detection in mitral trans esophageal acquisitions of the heart. Previous work supervised by Gabriel Kiss have been focusing on automatically detecting the mitral valve in 3D ultrasound data. This project aims at also detecting the aortic valve. The ultimate goal is automatic detection of anatomical structures running very fast (real-time if possible), so that the 3D data could automatic be presented in a way that makes sense to the physician, by rotating, cropping the 3D data based on the information detected in the images.

To find the optimal jacket design entails a minimization of the steel weight, while ensuring the structural integrity of the jacket as well as ensuring that it can be efficiently constructed. Kvaerner has made use of a genetic algorithm to optimise the jacket geometry, but while the algorithm itself is efficient, the third-party software used to evaluate the structures is more time consuming. This results in an interest of reducing the number of generations needed. Theoretical work includes: 1. Literature study of relevant methods used in structural design 2. Literature study of bio-inspired AI, and more generally stochastic optimization techniques, used in automated engineering 3. Literature study on methods used to avoid early convergence and how to handle costly fitness evaluation The starting point will be optimization via existing GA used by Kv\u00e6rner today. Calculating fitness is the main bottleneck today, so reducing the number of generations, reducing the population size, or other improved ways to handle the cost of fitness evaluation will be beneficial. To do so, the student group may, for example, study, implement, and test improvements in evolutionary algorithms, such as in crossover and mutation. Supporting mechanism will also be looked into. The group may also look into other options, such as avoiding the calculation of fitness every generation using the 3rd party program in use today.

It is an enabling technology with a wide range of applications. For example, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been an area which has contributed significantly to the general development of both AI and ML. In spite of impressive progress in recent years, conversational speech and colloquial dialect speech pose major problems for speech technology in general, and for the Norwegian language in particular. There are still significant application areas that require innovative solutions and breakthroughs in order to be fully realized.  Issues that must be resolved include both language technology in general and applications for the Norwegian language (and other resource-constrained languages). In fact, the importance of improving language technology, including speech recognition, in the handling of Norwegian has been highlighted by the Norwegian government's AI strategy document [1]. Problem Description Problem Description This project is part of a language technology initiative involving Telenor, NRK, National Library of Norway (NLN), and NTNU. The main goal of the initiative, hosted at the Norwegian Open AI Lab, is to improve language technology for the Norwegian language, by focusing on (i) speech-to-text transcription system capable of better transcribing multi-party conversations in realistic recording conditions (SCRIBE) and (ii) making text transcriptions (and thereby also the underlying speech content) available via improved automated metadata generation. In this project, MEGAS, the focus is on the automated metadata generation, including how metadata generated from text data (including transcribed speech) can improve access to, analysis of, utilization of, and overall benefit of the data. In a complementary project, SCRIBE, the goal is to study and develop solutions for machine transcription of Norwegian conversational speech. These two projects are, in other words, mutually beneficial to each other but at the same time somewhat independent. Data Availability Data Availability This project will be using NRK-provided TV-content with subtitle files; we will simply call it NRK\u2019s subtitled TV (NST) dataset.  The NST dataset, with 14,614 entities, consists of TV programs with Norwegian speech along with subtitles. This NST dataset will be interesting in its own right and also a stepping stone towards ASR-generated transcripts.  For this proposed MS Thesis project, in a language technology domain that is already relatively challenging, we believe that starting from relatively clean text data is quite reasonable.  In this project, the main focus will be on automated metadata generation from the subtitles in the NST dataset. Note that we are proposing to use a \u00absimpler\u00bb dataset compared to what one may obtain from ASR-transcriptions from Telenor, NRK, or NLN.   Consequently, the project will have a focus on the text processing aspects of language technology rather than \u00aberror-correcting\u00bb conversational speech transcripts generated using ASR.  Still, there are many challenges to address and results from the proposed project would be useful in the more general and complex setting of ASR transcripts of conversational speech encountered by Telenor, NRK, or NLN. Project and Thesis Descriptions Project and Thesis Descriptions High-quality language technology for Norwegian will strengthen the Norwegian language, enable efficient digitalization and information retrieval, simplify interfaces to public services for citizens, and provide invaluable assistance for people with special needs, to name but a few application areas of impact.  . Good quality metadata in addition to transcripts is required in order to enable such applications. For Norwegian, the capabilities of automated creation and utilization of metadata need to be strengthened, and this will \u2013 at a high level \u2013 be the the goal of this project.  The project can be suitable for one or two students, and the following tasks have been identified. Sketch for the Project Report: Perform a literature review of fundamental and applied algorithms for automated metadata generation (AMG) and similar methods for text.  The ultimate goal is improved AMG methods for transcribed spoken Norwegian, but the review should be broader and focus on problem definitions, mathematical frameworks, algorithms, software, metrics, datasets, and results.. Create a repository and interface for the NST dataset, optimized for AMG tasks, for example the AMG uses cases outlined below.. Discuss how the reviewed AI and ML algorithms and methods can be applied and extended in a resource-constrained language setting, in particular for Norwegian, with an eye towards the NST dataset and its potential applications.   Examples AMG use cases are:  accessibility, keyword and topic generation, content clustering, information retrieval, content summarization, language evolution analysis, and recommender systems.. Identify, adapt, or implement one (or more) simple AMG system(s) and connect it (them) to the NST dataset.  Here, existing AMG methods and systems from the literature will be used as starting points and benchmarks.. Document the work in a written Project Report.

The ownership of data/information has always been a concern but with GDPR there will be more awareness as well as more obligations related to data collection and sharing. Today data-monopolies like Facebook, Google, Amazon (FGA)  etc. are relying most of their business on the data they collect about people, and this without paying for this data. In the near future, people will conceive  information/data as \u201ccommodity\u201d, i.e., something that can be sold and bought. For example, with the enforcement of GDPR all people will be able to get the data that companies such as FGA collect about them and then sell it to smaller companies that may use this data for generating new business models. The topic of this thesis is to develop further the blockchain-based data marketplace that enables data selling and buying while resolving trust and privacy problems. The Data Marketplace uses Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts to allow peers to communicate about the conditions of data sharing and perform the data exchange itself. For example, this platform will make me able to sell my facebook data to a company and provide service to me for  bargaining about the price as well as  including my privacy preferences and constraints into the deal.

Available simulation environments, the best known perhaps CARLA, focus mainly on realistically looking (photorealistic) appearance of the rendered scenes. They are very well suited for testing computer vision methods (the main perception component in autonomous driving) as well as for testing so-called end-to-end approaches for driving a car. In contrast to this, the present project assumes that a close-to-perfect perception component for the car's environment is already existing, leading to a detailed and precise so-called 'grid map' representation of the dynamic scene around the car. This is what also has (almost) been achieved in the automotive industry. The remaining challenges are more about how to act as a (simulated) driver, \u00a0if perfect knowledge about your environment is given. The main research questions to be addressed when such a simulator is available (as the result of the project proposed here) build on this available grid map representation and deal with the question how to steer and control a car in a dense traffic situation, e.g. in an urban environment during rush hours. In order to allow for this, it is needed to use very realistic vehicle models (which can be bought as 'assets' from the web) and use the same 'intelligent driving agent' an many exemplars of such cyber cars. 'Many' starts from, say, 10 cars, and could go up to several hundred ones, depending on the available computing ressources. In order to create this, a given game engine (currently envisaged: Unity) has to be enabled to be run in kind of a multi-user game fashion, and a realistic, urban-like road network has to be created. The challenge of this project is not photorealism in the visualization of the scene, but the creation of a realistic physics based model of a complex traffic scene, the creation of multiple car-centered abstract representations of the dynamic situation around each single car, and the implementation of an upscalable multi-user multi-agent simulation. In other words: this is not about creating photorealistic videos and processing them, but rather than that, this is about a dynamic simulation of traffic on the basis of a 3D structure representation of the scene. If desired, the project student(s) could also try out control schemes based on e.g. reinforement learning in order to show the overall functionality of the simulator, but the main purpose and goal of the project is the creation of the simulator.

Thus emphasis is not on speed, but on 'intelligence', behaviour, and autonomy. Parallel to this project which needs to first address the mechatronics and the main on-board computing used for communication and control, there is a another project dealing with developing the 'perception component' for the mobile robot. In the ideal case, the students of the \"mobile platform\" (=this project) and the \"perception unit\" projects would cooperate closely, but each project can also be executed individually.

You will be provided a planner that allows collision-free navigation and exploration in unknown environments as a reference.

Supervised learning requires data instances annotated with the correct output labels, but the other paradigms assume no such labelled data. Reinforcement learning is primarily concerned with what actions an intelligent agent (or group of agents) should take in a specified environment in order to maximise some cumulative reward, while simultaneously exploring the environment and exploiting previously accumulated knowledge. The environment is commonly formulated as a Markov decision process or as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), depending on whether the agent can observe the current environmental state directly or whether the observed states are distorted by noise. Reinforcement learning agents have shown strong performance on classical games, making this an interesting approach to test in general in the context of computational creativity. However, a creative \u201cgame\u201d type setting using the standard Monte Carlo algorithm can be a time-consuming process. An alternative can then be to utilise strategies that combine ideas from neural network type set-ups with evolutionary approaches (e.g., compositional pattern-producing networks; Stanley 2007) or model-free reinforcement learning such as Q-learning (or deep Q-learning as introduced by Google DeepMind; Mnih et al. 2015, Silver et al. 2018), which only learns the value of an action in a particular state (stochastic transitions and rewards), without having a model of the environment.

Computer vision for robots, self-driving cars, and also for driver assistance very often assumes very good visibility conditions -- the area is very much dominated by the nice weather conditions that are found when driving e.g. in the Silicon Valley environment. However, autonomous driving or visual driver assistance in the Nordic Countries needs to deal very often with bad weather conditions: rain or snow, thus wet or snow-covered road surfaces, making vision conditions even worse by the froth or spray caused by vehicles in front of the own one. This project deals with the exploration what the combination of machine learning and classicial computer vision methods can do in order to detect other vehicles in a distance, road markings, side barriers, and other obstacles as early and as robustly as possible. One way often being taken in the (sparse) literature about this important topic is to try to improve the quality of the incoming image/video material and subsequently employ 'off-the-shelf' / textbook computer vision algorithms. We do not think that this is the best way to proceed; rather than that, the methods of detecting objects (e.g. in spray, snow, or haze) and the methods for estimating distances and the 3D structure of the environment should consider the afflicted image acquisition process from the very start, and design new algorithms that can cope with the image degradations either by modeling them explicitly (classical approach), or by training learning-based approaches. The topic of visual environment perception and situation assessment under bad visibility conditions is of course not only of interest in conjunction with cars and road traffic, but equally also for marine applications.

The stories are presented as complete texts that are supposed to be read from beginning to end.  For small devices like mobile phones it may be interesting to look into other ways of presenting news stories.  In some recent experiments news stories have been broken up into several pieces that have either been structured as a conversation or presented piece by piece by avatars. In this project we will investigate how summarization techniques and conversational agents (chatbots) can be used to present news stories in more interactive innovate ways.  Summarization techniques help us extract prominent sentences or generate new summative sentences of the stories.  The project needs to explore how conversational agents, that normally need chat logs or mapping rules to work, can be modified to work with news stories rather than logs as input.

CNN-based object tracking is another area of our interest.  The annual Visual Object Tracking (VOT) challenge is a good reference to follow the state-of-the-art results. . Our unique challenge is that the cracks often have irregular shapes such as very thin lines and follow arbitrary directions. The object detection models which output horizontal bounding boxes may not yield satisfied detection results. The object detection model which outputs oriented bounding boxes might provide better detection results (i.e., tightly bound the actual cracks). . Since VOT 2015, rotated bounding box annotations are used by the VOT committee to provide highly accurate ground truth values for comparing results. That means the winners of VOT should have developed the corresponding models/solutions to output rotated bounding boxes.      . The first research question is to investigate whether existing VOT models/solutions can be used to detect cracks in ship survey images? . However, the CNN based object tracking models require a large amount of training data to achieve a good performance level,. and so far, the number of available training images is in the order. of several thousands of images, and it is hard to go beyond that by orders of magnitude, as one could wish.. Therefore, the second research question is to investigate the suitable approach for generating synthetic video sequences for training a CNN-based object tracking model.

Once the plastic reaches the oceans, it is broken down into smaller particles(micro-plastic) by being exposed to ultra violet (UV) radiation and mechanical abrasion from wave actions [1].The quantity of plastic waste floating at the ocean surface in 2013 was estimated to be approximately 269,000 tonnes (small macro- to micro-plastic), this estimate does not include plastic in-depth or at the seafloor). The plastic debris can affect the wildlife in multiple ways, such as entanglement- entrapping, encircling, or constricting,ingestion- accidental ingestion or ingestion of prey containing plastic, and interaction- being in contact with plastic debris [1].It is therefore important to be able to detect and collect the plastic waste in nature,before it reaches the oceans. Once plastic waste has reaches a micro-stadium, it is near impossible to collect it and remove it from the water. An analysis on deep sea locations(range from 1176 to 4843m) showed that there was an average abundance of 1 micro-plastic per 25cm3(particle sizes ranging from 75 to 161\u03bcm) [2] The AI-task will support the observation and monitoring of plastic items\u200b at consumer side, such as cities, beaches..... We will monitor the geographic distribution of different types of plastic items in these areas. The data will be gathered by citizens in form of taking photos of plastic objects. The photos will be taken using an application on smart phones. The application will have an artificial intelligence (deep learning) algorithm specially tailored for recognition of the material type of the plastic in the photos. The combined information about the geographic distribution, plastic type, and the object type (e.g., bottle, bag) pertinent to plastic debris will be collected in a database which in turn will be statistically analyzed and visualized. The smart application will serve as a tool for empowering citizen science and will contribute to the increase of the awareness and collaboration of citizens towards mitigation of plastic pollution problem.

This topic combines modern method of video processing, in particular scene tracking an camera motion estimation with detection methods which today most often come from the domain of machine learning. The approach to the crack detection problem proposed here exploits that idea that cracks typically do not only have a two-dimensional appearance (for instance, like a line drawn on the material), but also have a three-dimensional structure, often a very tiny gap in the surface. It can be expected that a moving camera, in particular when it carries its own illumination, will show the crack not only by its two-dimensional appearance, but also by the change of this appearance, caused by illumination and image acquisition from different viewpoints.. In order to exploit this effect, a set of image frames from the video stream has to \u2018motion-compensated\u2019, that is: the position and orientation of a crack candidate is stabilized in the visual field for a short while, say, for about 3 seconds or 10-100 image frames. Here, temporal subsampling, that is: taking only each n-th frame may be permitted. In the stabilized image subsequence, it is expected that the crack varies in appearance in a typical way which is related to the change of illumination.. The motion-compensated image subsequence is then fed into a detection unit which does not work on a single RGB image, but on a stack of such images. A deep network trained on true (or synthetic) crack images with a CNN in the front end is a highly promising candidate for the detector architecture. Also for this task it will be a challenge to come up with training methods that allow to train the network with a limited set of training images.. A potential side aspect of this task which might turn out to be of key importance to the feasibility of the solution is the attempt to generated synthetic, but still realistic crack images, e.g. by combining real crack images which are artificially augmented by a hallucinated 3D surface structure and \u2018re-illuminated\u2019 using advanced computer graphics methods. This approach is optional, but might develop into a rewarding endeavour for students which are also interest in image rendering.

Revolve is participating to this yearly competition already for a number of years. Each year, a new version of this race car is developed, and of course it is a fundamental goal of the overall Revolve project to achieve a good rank in the annual competition. The project addressed in this Masters or preproject/Masters topic is to develop a solid and precise method for estimating both the ego-motion of the race car as well as the structure of the environment through which this race car moves. With this goal, the project builds on the results and experiences of the previous project / Masters thesis work. The aim is to further increase both the stability as well as the precision of the previous method and experiment with new components and approaches to be used in the context of egomotion estimation and map building. Currently, the egomotion and map building component (here also called 'dynamic state estimation') uses mainly LiDaR measurements to build a map of the environment, which is essentially a plane racing ground and a track which is marked by cones put on the track boundaries. It uses a so-called graph-based SLAM approach, building on available libraries for graph-based optimiization, in particular the iSAM2 library by Kaess, Dellaert et al. In the new approach, the individual components of the existing system will be re-inspected in depth, in particular in the area of data association. This term denotes the process of associating each detected landmark (here: the LiDaR-detected cones) at time instant N with the correctly corresponding landmark at time instant N+1. As the cones all look the same, and as the cone detector will sometimes produce errors (cones missed, or wrong cones hallucinated), this problem is difficult, and it is of utmost importance to make this association right, as even few undetected 'outliers' in the measurements / detection result can lead to catastrophic consequences in the egomotion estimation and map building. The approaches to be investigated in the new version of the SLAM algorithm focus on this data association process. They will explicitly use a dynamic model of the car motion and extensive statistical modeling of the landmark detector reliability as well as statistical modeling of all other sources of error in the data processing process, as far as the tolerable computational effort allows for this. It is also desired that the data association process is implemented using criteria for self-supervision. The possibiliy of multi-hypothesis operation, and using backtracking and 'warm restart' in case of (rare) failures of the overall dynamic state estimation process should be investigated. Optionally, it can be investigated if and where usage of modern machine learning methods may contribute to a safe and solid solution to the dynamic state estimation process. The project requires experience in statistical data analysis, or the willingness to acquire corresponding background knowledge in the preparatory phase, interest or experience in real time programming, and of course some enthusiasm towards the idea of building an 'intelligent car'.

Contact persons: Professor Jo Kramer-Johansen (NAKOS), H\u00e5vard Wahl Kongsg\u00e5rd (NAKOS) Problem Description Problem Description In emergency medicine, time is of the essence. Acute conditions like stroke, myocardial infarction, major trauma, and cardiac arrest, result in loss of vital functions and life within minutes. EMCC is the key to rapid first aid when the public calls them for help by providing first aid instructions, but definitive treatment requires arrival of qualified personnel and often, rapid transport to hospital. However, most cases handled by the EMCC, are of less acuity, and to aid call takers at the EMCC to decide and prioritize, they use a paper-based triage-tool. Both acute and less acute cases may need ambulance transport, and usage of available resources are high and growing. When an ambulance transports a patient, it is not available for other missions, so usage of ambulance resources must balance the current load of missions and availability for the next (unknown) acute case. The current solution involves specially trained and experienced dispatchers (Resource Coordinators \u2013 RC) in the EMCC that manually assigns each mission to an ambulance, maintaining the delicate balance of workload and contingency within geographic regions. EMCC in Oslo is the largest in Norway and answers calls to the medical emergency phone number 113 from a population of 1.6 million (Oslo, Akershus, and \u00d8stfold). The available resources includes 29 (night) to 45 (day) ambulances based at 15 ambulance stations. Each year EMCC handles 500 000 telephone calls, and the Ambulance department executes more than 150 000 missions each year. Data Set Data Set The existing data set is an extract from the clinical data system used in EMCC to record each mission \u2013 (Akuttmedisinsk informasjonssystem, AMIS). Each mission has a position that has been mapped to a standardized 1000 by 1000 m grid from SSB (Statistics Norway). We will anonymize the dataset, but the SSB-grid ties each mission to more sociodemographic information, as well as historical information such as traffic, weather and climate, public events, and moveable public holidays. Each observation is per grid per hour and includes; number of events, response intervals for both acute and non-acute missions, and idle-time. Example information: GRID_ID. DATOTID.

Today, Capeesh produces and delivers bespoke and gamified mobile language courses to industries and businesses that hire and train non-native speakers. This helps businesses in both public and private sectors give people with minority languages the language training they need to conduct their work. Additionally, Capeesh is collaborating with a EU funded project EasyRights, the goal of which is to use AI technology to make it easier for immigrants to understand and access the services they are entitled to. The student that is going to collaborate with Capeesh will be integrated into our development team and a disposable desk at our office in Trondheim. Hence, the student has the possibility to get work experience in a scaling innovative company. Problem Description Problem Description Capeesh is today using a pipeline of NLP technology to automatically create industry-specific language courses. The courses are divided up into vocabulary and comprehension exercises, both encouraging the learner to train on their writing, reading, speaking and listening. The speaking and writing exercises have room for improvement in regards to dialog generation and learner input evaluation and feedback. Hence, we want to apply Custom AI-Generated Text both in speech dialogues and for automatic feedback generation. In addition, we need an AI-agent which can select the most appropriate feedback and learning path recommendation. The feedback would be in the forms of live reaction, briefs (to prepare the learner for what is going to happen in a lesson and what the learner may have difficulties with) and debriefs (to pinpoint what should be the next step). The learning path recommendation would be to suggest the optimal learning path for the learner.

A common obstacle for industrial companies is that they have data residing in many different systems without common identificators (assets, time series, 3D models, documents, etc). To gain value from digitalization it's important to be able to work across several data sources - e.g. click on something in a 3D and see its sensor time series. Entity matching is the problem of deciding which records from two different data sources refer to the same real-world entity. In this project the student(s) will explore how one can utilize NLP techniques in entity matching when one of the data sources are documents. While typical records only contain short (usually structured) strings, we are sometimes interested in matching with larger documents, for example matching documents describing pieces of equipment. Current entity matching methods does not support this in a good way, and so we need to explore how existing techniques from NLP and/or information retrieval can be integrated.

A common obstacle for industrial companies is that they have data residing in many different systems without common identificators (assets, time series, 3D models, documents, etc). To gain value from digitalization it's important to be able to work across several data sources - e.g. click on something in a 3D and see its sensor time series. Entity matching is the problem of deciding which records from two different data sources refer to the same real-world entity. In this project the student(s) will explore how a domain expert can efficiently match records from two data sources interactively with the assistance of a machine learning model. While the matching process cannot normally be a fully automatic one, there are still some structures and patterns that make it feasible to assist the user in various ways.

Developmental neural networks may be a method toward new network architectures and training regimes that can expand what problem ANNs can efficiently solve.

ANNs was originally proposed as a model for how the brain processes information. The concept emerged as a way to compute and as an abstraction to understand the brain.  ANNs are traditionally defined as a fixed structure. Neurons are spatially defined as part of the Input layer, hidden layers or output layer connected by directed weighted edges. The neurons compute a non-linear function of the sum of its inputs, the edges are a linear transformation (weighted) from neuron output to neuron input. The functionality of the network is a product of the set of weights (and neuron function) present in the network. Generally a feedforward network. The weights for a specific functionality is found by some training algorithm, There is some defined scheme for adjusting the weights based on a performance measurement of the network. Adjustment is based on the performance on the network on some test at current time (t), the network is adjusted and tested again at t + 1, and so on. Currently (in most schemes) the weight adjustment is done weight by weight, there is no dependency between the individual weight adjustments. Even though ANNs now is top of the pops once more with deep learning, convolutional neural networks and all the other buzz around there are few fundamental new principles and methods, i.e. the network architecture is a fixed structure forming a feedforward network, using some training process based on global information.

The idea is to develop a causal model that includes things like exhaust from vehicles, use of studs, wood burning, ship traffic, cleaning of roads, \u2026, and their  impact on air quality.  In other words, the goal is to develop a causal model containing causes and effects related to air quality, perform machine learning from air quality and related data, and improve understanding and decision making related to air quality in many municipalities. The project is inspired by a report \"Driftstiltak mot svevest\u00f8v i Trondheim kommune:  Erfaringsrapport for tiltak f\u00f8r og etter 2013,\" where one finds the following quote on page 2 (see also Figure 1 in the report):  . \"Trolig har samtlige tiltak bidratt til at det nasjonale m\u00e5let [for luftkvalitet] ble tilfredsstilt i 2015.

The analysis will be performed by constructing a causal model containing both observable and latent random random variables along with their causal connections, and performing machine learning and analysis of air quality and related datasets. Such a causal model can be used for several purposes; we propose to study the following: Intervention analysis: which intervention(s) to perform in a certain situation of poor air quality?. Counterfactual analysis: which of the many actions taken from 2000 to 2013  were the main causes of improvements in air quality?  In other words, had the action(s) not been taken, would the improvements in air quality not have happened?

While the idea is to start with datasets for Trondheim, it would be useful for these concepts to be defined in a generic manner such that they can be used in other municipal cases as well.  In other words, it should be part of the project to study (i) the transfer of (parts of) the causal model between cities or municipalities or or (ii) how to adapt the model to different municipalities.  If such transfer or adaptation is possible, there can be great value in air quality decision making in many municipalities.

Problem Description Problem Description At SINTEF, we are often asked to assess ocean locations with respect to environmental properties or marine activities with respect to environmental risk. In order to do that, it is preferable to have several years with modelled ocean data to account for different seasons and yearly variations in conditions. It is hard for a human to understand these data and to pick periods or areas that are relevant or typical for the application. Per today these data are analysed with normal statistics, like means / max / variations. For operations planning or planned discharges it would be nice to understand patterns in the data and either find suitable periods or areas in the ocean or be able to exclude them for protection. Thesis Description Thesis Description Machine learning for effective ocean data analysis Apply different machine learning methods to find commonalities in ocean data that are meaningful to marine operations (pollution transport, aquaculture). Ocean data is 4 dimensional, with 3 spatial dimensions plus time, so the data is like several sensor readings (currents, temperature, salinity) over time and in space (like cubes in a Rubik cube, with each cube being several sensors). We want to understand the correlation and patterns in these data. Data Data We can use data that is available from met via https://thredds.met.no/ and possibly combine modelled (Ocean & Ice, Norkyst800) with observations (Observations, SVV E39) and aquaculture production data from Barentswatch https://www.barentswatch.no/havbruk/? Ocean model data come in netCDF and are around 5 GB per month for whole Norwegian waters. A\u00a0subset will be sufficient for this work.

More often than not, the analyses deal with the issue by analysing only a single dataset at time, as the biases are difficult to accurately describe. Ironically, combining datasets with different biases can be used to identify and eliminate the biases, and keep only the genuine biological variation. The goal of this project is creating a machine-learning algorithm to automatically identify consistent expression profiles in biological data, and biases associated to individual experiment designs. The student will learn how to apply machine learning to real-world data. The problem may be approached both as designing an estimator or creating a classifier. The expression profiles can be perceived as signals at a higher abstraction level, and a thorough understanding of the biology behind is not necessary. Nevertheless, basic understanding of the experimental designs will be required to adequately massage the data for the machine-learning model. The focus is mainly on RNA expression data, and should include microarray and RNA-seq data. Relevant experimental designs to include in the work are time-series experiments (measurements at time-intervals following introduction of/release from a treatment) and data comparing two experimental conditions. An example of the former might be measuring expression throughout cell-cycle upon releasing the cell culture from a treatment blocking the cell culture to progress past a certain point in the cell cycle. An example of the latter could be siRNA screens, where a given RNA is post-transcriptionally degraded by introducing a specifically designed siRNA. The topic is research-oriented, and students can choose whichever machine-learning approach and programming language they deem convenient.

The emphasis will be on the integration of methods from evolutionary algorithms and stochastic local search, with a focus on both theory and applications. In artificial intelligence and machine learning, there are several methods that use or rely on randomization: mutation and crossover in evolutionary algorithms [Goldberg, 1989], probabilistic acceptance in simulated annealing, dropout and stochastic gradient descent in deep learning, stochastic local search (SLS) [Selman et al., 1992] [Hoos & St\u00fctzle, 2005] [Mengshoel et al., 1998], and randomization in systematic search [Gomes et al., 1998]. Stochastic optimization (SO) algorithms, which include stochastic local search (SLS) and evolutionary algorithms (EAs), will be a main focus in this project.    Stochastic optimization (SO) algorithms are among the best in solving computationally hard problems including NP-hard problems such as satisfiability (SAT), traveling salesman (TSP), scheduling, and most probable explanations in Bayesian networks (BNs) [Selman et al., 1992] [Hoos & St\u00fctzle, 2005] [Mengshoel et al., 2010] [Mengshoel et al., 2016] [Pal & Mengshoel, 2016]. Research on SO performed by me and my collaborators has focused on (i) improving the theoretical foundation of SO; (ii) empirically demonstrating the benefit of SO using natural and synthetic problem instances; and (iiii) applying the approach in diverse areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning. For (i), we have for instance analyzed homogenous Markov chains to derive instructive expected hitting time results [Mengshoel, 2008] [Mengshoel et al., 2016]. For (ii) and (iii), we have demonstrated that SO algorithms can be competitive for applications including computing the most probably explanation (MPE) in Bayesian networks; feature selection in machine learning; and sparse signal recovery in signal processing [Mengshoel et al., 2010] [Mengshoel et al., 2011] [Mengshoel et al., 2014] [Pal & Mengshoel, 2016] [Yu et al., 2017] [Liu et al., 2018]. Despite several successes, the current state-of-the-art suffers from some drawbacks, creating research opportunities in several areas. In this research project, we will explore those opportunities and develop novel ideas at the interface of stochastic local search, machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, probabilistic graphical models, and deep learning.  Special attention will be paid to multimodal functions, which play a central role in artificial intelligence and evolutionary algorithms. There appears to be several limiting factors when it comes to existing work on SO for such multimodal functions, including the following. Firsrt, multimodal optimization algorithms often search for \u201cas many local optima as possible\u201d without input or guidance from a decision maker. Second, evolutionary algorithms have been used for certain combinatorial optimization problems including feature selection, but there has been surprisingly little emphasis on diversity maintenance including niching in research on machine learning including feature selection. The integration of local search and evolutionary algorithms has, to some extent, been studied in the literature, often under the term memetic algorithms (MAs) [Eiben & Smith, 2015] [Krasnogor & Smith, 2005] [Xue et al., 2016]. Intuitively, the goal of an MA is for the EA component to search well globally, while the SLS component\u2019s goal is to optimize locally. In other words, one wants \u201cthe best of both worlds.\u201d There is a broad diversity of different MA types and designs [Krasnogor & Smith, 2005] [Xue et al., 2016]. Both Lamarckian and Baldwinian MAs have been studied, reflecting the spirited discussion between Lamarck and Baldwin in evolutionary biology in the late 1800. Current research seems to favor Lamarckian MAs, in which the locally optimized individual replaces the original individual in the population. Focus in Project Focus in Project The focus of the project is on the integration of SLS and EA methods, inspired by so-called memetic algorithms (MAs), to be analyzed and tested on synthetic and natural problems.  Several MA-based approaches to feature selection [Kannan & Ramaraj, 2010] [Xue et al., 2016] [Lee et al., 2019] have been developed, inspiring this proposed research project. To be investigated are methods that addresses the issues identified above, and perhaps others, by integrating multiple different methods, and carefully balancing their execution via parameter tuning and control [Krafotias et al., 2015] [Mengshoel et al., 2014] [Mengshoel et al., 2016] [Yu et al., 2017]. An interesting idea is to combine stochastic local search, evolutionary computing, clustering, and feedback control algorithms, with emphasis on the balance between exploration and exploitation during search. Such balance can be achieved by means of niching, for example crowding [Mengshoel et al., 2014].  The goal will be to empirically test such a multi-method algorithm on synthetic and natural combinatorial function optimization problems, including ML problems (for example feature selection or network search problems), and empirically establish performance relative to other methods. For the more theoretically oriented student, theory development would be of great interest [Mengshoel, 2008] [Nguyen & Sudholt, 2020]. The project can be suitable for one or two students.  The students will participate in one or more of the following tasks in this proposed project: Identify or develop limitations or problems with the current SO state-of-the-art, with focus on  memetic algorithms (MAs) [Kannan & Ramaraj, 2010]  [Xue et al., 2016] [Lee et al., 2019] [Nguyen & Sudholt, 2020], structure search [Elsken et al., 2019]; hyper-parameter optimization [Krafotias et al., 2015] [Mengshoel et al., 2016] [Yu et al., 2017]; and impact of varying computational context (data set, problem, computer, \u2026 )..

Here, optimization for machine learning, explainable AI, decision support, and human computer interaction (image captioning, for example) are example problems..

When studying eukaryotic cell cycle, the most common approach involves synchronizing a cell culture. In this method, the cells, grown in a medium, are prevented to progress through the cell cycle past a certain phase, usually through use of a chemical agent. The block is then released, and the cells are allowed to progress through the cell cycle. We can assign each cell a phase angle \u03b1, representing its progress in the cell cycle. Then, we can describe the cell-cycle phase distribution of a culture. Moreover, for cell-cycle related genes, we may represent their expression as a function of \u03b1. An unsynchronized culture will then attain an equilibrium distribution, whereas a synchronized culture starts with a narrow phase distribution, which then evolves in time upon release of the block, converging to the said equilibrium distribution. In this project, the student should create a model that captures the evolution of cell-cycle phase distribution in time, upon synchronizing cells of different types, using different synchronization methods. Specifically, certain synchronization methods cause initially slower, or vice versa faster, cell cycle. Moreover, the cells may not behave completely alike to one another, but may rather feature several distinct populations. A model for this stratification might take as a starting point data from single cell sequencing. Besides the advancements for fundamental research, such a model should prove useful in deconvolving and interpolating expression profiles from different experiments, thereby making the data comparable. The current state-of-the-art models are rather unsophisticated, and a student might very well come up with a state-of-the-art model, applying known methods of function approximation, machine learning, or even generalizing certain models from physics. The model would be tested and verified on synthetic, as well as experimental data on phase distribution in experiments (fluorescence-activated cell sorting data), and in cooperation with the student applied to the existing analyses in our group.

This project is a joint project of Akvaplan-niva AS and NTNU.\n\nProblem description: In recent years, the use of Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) for research and mitigation purposes has dramatically increased, with new studies encouraging its use. Acoustic data provide scientific insights in a broad range of fields including animal vocalizations (biophony) and anthropogenic noise (anthrophony) in the marine environment. Yet, the amount of human effort required to manually identify acoustic features and events rapidly becomes limiting as the size of the data sets increase. Machine learning has the potential to handle large data sets and address many questions in the field of passive acoustic such as automatic detection and classification of sound events. However, the sound from these sources reverberates in the environment which profoundly distorts the original source waveform or can be masked by other sounds overlapping in time and frequencies. Thus the signal recorded usually contains a mixture of highly variable unknown sources, each distorted by the environment in an unknown fashion. Moreover, the noise produced by system events of unmanned autonomous vehicles (gliders) while carrying the hydrophones can saturate the recordings. This issue can mask the detections. Some of the suggested objectives: \u2022 Develop an automatic system able to detect and identify non-biological sound sources. \u2022 Detection of events with time overlap between biotic and abiotic sound sources. \u2022 Develop an algorithm able to automatically identify and filter out the noise events produced by the gliders To achieve the above goals, this project is divided into the following sub-projects: I. Investigate the possibility of applying existing state-of-the-art deep learning methods to solve the above tasks. As part of this, the candidate is expected to perform a state-of-the-art literature review and implement the most relevant method(s) to create automatic detector(s) that can solve the problem. II.

To reach the EU goal of cutting carbon emissions from the building sector there are two main strategies: increase building efficiency and increase the low/zero carbon energy sources [1]. According to IEA, an increase in CO2 price and a stronger interconnection of the power grid between Norway and continental Europe is expected in the future.. The exchange of power with neighbouring countries will therefore strongly influence the CO2 intensity (CO2eq) of the electricity mix. The analysis of this parameter is of high importance, as it indicates the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix. The CO2eq. intensity can be used as a penalty signal in buildings to trigger certain delayable functions (such as the use of machines or power or heat accumulation) and shift their operation towards times in which the fraction of renewable energy in the energy mix is highest. Doing so, the use of the CO2eq. intensity as penalty signal can help to reduce overall emissions from energy systems, especially on the demand side.. Some scholars have started studying the possibility of development of machine learning algorithms that are able to forecast the CO2 emission intensity of the power grid [2,3]. An interesting improvement of this methods will be the development of a method to forecast the marginal CO2eq [4].   Data Data We recommend the use of grid data (gathered online) such as the hourly electricity generation per generation technology per bidding zone, which can be retrieved from ENTSO-E.

Context:. The rapid diffusion of digital information technologies has created an explosive growth in the amount of digital data. Data is a key asset to compete in today\u2019s business. Digitalization is concerned with using software and data to offer significantly improved products, pure software products as well as digital and data driven services. The intent is to create new revenue opportunities as well as replace traditional business models with new business models. Driving the digital transformation is especially challenging as it brings with it the rapid sequence of three technologies that build on each other, i.e. software, data and artificial intelligence (AI). Although traditionally the focus has been on software, increasingly the latter topics are becoming more important. It is data that allow us to generate insights that are far from obvious to the human mind and to detect patterns in large amounts of data that are elusive otherwise. AI and specially machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), provide technology to identify these patterns in data and then act on these patterns to deliver solutions that were unfeasible before or that function much better with the use of AI.  To be able to handle the challenges of AI engineering, the software development needs to change. The organizations will need to change their business models, as well as business strategy, the architecture of products, systems and services, ways of working, processes and tools as well as organizational structure of the company. The demand for innovation now, calls for a revolutionary mindset that combines skillsets that are not traditionally found in software teams. Software engineering as a critical core capability where best practices are changing rapidly. With the pervasive use and the dependence on AIbased systems, the quality of these systems becomes essential for their practical usage. However, quality assurance for AI-based systems is an emerging area that has not been well explored and requires collaboration between the SE and AI research communities.

Basically, this amounts to not only providing result values, but a probability distribution about the range of possible output values. I propose to firstly compile the latest literature on this topic, often associated with the term \"Bayesian Neural Networks\", but taking also into consideration the recent work on 'out of distribution' detection, that is: the detection of the cases where the input data is outside of the range of input data that has been covered by the training data set.

The autonomous technology company Zeabuz (POC Dr. Smogeli), which is located in Trondheim, is developing autonomous urban passenger ferries and seeking to perform state-of-the-art safety validation. Safety is also a key challenge in aerospace, and the concepts of adaptive stress testing has been developed by NASA ARC (POC Dr. Lee) and NASA\u2019s partners to meet that challenge. At NTNU, the Norwegian Open AI Lab (advisor Prof. Mengshoel) will be hosting the students working on the project. It is forecast that a steadily increasing percentage of the world population will be living in cities. However, city growth is often limited by lack of scalable infrastructure and congested road traffic leading to excessive emissions. At the same time, many cities are built by historical waterways such as lakes, rivers, canals, bays, fjords or harbour basins. Often, these waterways are largely unused, while they separate districts and limit mobility. Meeting these challenges with bridges and tunnels is a costly, non-scalable and inflexible solution, causing a large footprint while not meeting future problems due to likely increasing water levels. In contrast, establishing shortcuts across and along existing waterways that connect and revitalize urban areas is a sustainable, flexible, efficient and compelling solution for cities and citizens. Zeabuz is developing core technologies and solutions that can enable more environmentally friendly and flexible mobility solutions in urban areas. The Zeabuz mobility system consists of a network of electric, autonomous passenger ferries with centrally located docking and charging stations, high bandwidth communication and a remote support centre. NTNU and Zeabuz are together deploying the milliAmpere 2 (mA2) pilot ferry for trial operation in Trondheim in the summer of 2021. The mA2 will be a fully operational passenger ferry with an autonomy system developed by NTNU researchers, designed to operate along a fixed path across the canal between Ravnkloa and Vestre Kanalkai. The autonomy system shall be able to avoid objects and handle any traffic situation that could occur in this Operational Design Domain (ODD). In parallel, NTNU and Zeabuz are developing an mA2 digital twin, which is a complete simulator of the autonomous ferry and its operating environment in the Trondheim canal. This enables simulation of any kind of operational scenario in a synthetic environment. Problem Description Problem Description The Zeabuz autonomous mobility system is a complex, software intensive system, enabled by artificial intelligence and subject to an unpredictable operating environment, that needs to be actively managed throughout its life-cycle. This makes formal safety proofs (practically) impossible. Instead, one needs to resort to statistical considerations in the safety argumentation. In other words, there is a need to argue \u2013 based on the accumulated experience, testing, verification and validation activities we have collected \u2013 that the system is sufficiently safe. Experience from the aerospace and automotive industries, which have been dealing with similar challenges for autonomous aircraft and cars for some time, shows that testing and real-world experience is not sufficient \u2013 even with a large fleet of aircraft or cars.  The reason for this is that the number of possible critical scenarios the system needs to handle is practically unlimited. The only viable solution appears to be large-scale simulations of the system and its environment, where the full parameter space of possible scenarios in principle can be explored [2]. However, this triggers the problem of designing and selecting which scenarios to run among the near infinite number of possible parameter combinations. Example questions that show up are: How to ensure that scenarios are relevant and representative? How to cover the critical \u201ccorner cases\u201d? How to find the \u201cweak spots\u201d in the system and force it towards failure? How to evaluate the system performance? To solve these issues, we need a systematic and effective way of designing, running, and evaluating simulation scenarios that together give sufficient confidence in the safety of the Zeabuz autonomous ferry system.  This proposed MS project will be contributing towards this goal. Data Availability Data Availability The project is suitable for one or two students (for simplicity we will say \u201cstudents\u201d below).  The students will get access to the milliAmpere 2 digital twin, which is a complete simulator of the autonomous ferry and its operating environment in the Trondheim canal. For this project, the simulations can be parameterized in terms of the traffic situation, meaning the candidate can specify what kind of vessels that will be part of the scene and how they will move and act with respect to mA2. In principle, any kind of operational scenario can be designed and deployed in the mA2 digital twin, meaning it can serve as the backbone of such a test system. Depending on actual data availability, the candidate may also get access to full-scale data from experiments, if this is found to be of relevance. Project and Thesis Descriptions Project and Thesis Descriptions The thesis will employ, adapt and extend a method called adaptive stress testing (AST) to find likely failure events of the autonomy system in mA2, using reinforcement learning (RL) and other AI and ML techniques [1,2,3,4,5]. The AST method has previously been used to validate aircraft collision avoidance systems [3,4,5], which is a similar problem.

Document the work in a written MS Thesis. Regarding \u00abalgorithmic extensions to AST\u00bb as mentioned above:  Since AST is based on RL, exploration of these ideas will first start on the RL side, and then be adapted to AST based on experiences with the Zeabuz requirements and simulation. Here are some ideas for such algorithmic extensions: Multi-objective or constrained reinforcement learning formulation: Currently two objectives are blended by a weight in AST [4].  One can handle this more elegantly with a multi-objective or constraint framework.  Here, the idea is to study multi-objective RL or constrained RL for AST.. Uncertainty estimation of AST results: Currently, AST uses RL as a solver, which doesn't return any uncertainty/confidence on the results. It would be interesting to explore uncertainty or confidence RL frameworks for AST: Deep ensembles, Bayesian methods, etc.. Improve exploration in RL in AST by: (i) tweaking the starting distribution or (ii) exploring diversity-, curiosity-, entropy-, or novelty-driven RL for AST. For (ii) the idea is to study methods such as DIAYN; another related idea is curriculum RL.

The main idea is that ego-motion of a robot can be learned from the visual input in combination with data from an inertial measurement uni (IMU) which is able to sense translational acceleration and rotational velocity. This is (hypothetically) the same way how humans and animals learn to perceive their motion, by combining data from visual input and the inner ear (sense of balance). In the project, a suitable camera with build-in IMU (Intel Realsense) shall be used to first collect extensive data (video and IMU recordings), and then in step 2 design an architecture that learns to derive the desired information (translation and rotation of the camera) from that data. We think of really huge data sets in the order of magnitude of 1 Terabyte as the relation to be learned is more complex as this simplified project description can convey. One important principle to be followed in this project is that we search for an architecture which is as sparse as possible while being still in the position to solve the given problem reliably. This means, it is _not_ intended to \"simply\" try a very deep architecture and solve the problem by computational overkill. The basis for this \"sparse\" and efficient solution is that quite a lot is known about motion perception in biological systems and in computer vision. The front end of the envisaged structure is a CNN with a spatio-temporal (that is: 3dimensional) input layer, 1 time dimension and 2 spatial dimensions. In other words, the primary information processing layer does not only work on 2 images (as in many approaches), but on a stack of N images, N >>2. This refers to the fact that the projection of most motions onto the retina (or camera image plane) is mostly a smooth curve; things do not oscillate wildly when we regard them, but they move (mostly) smoothly across the image plane. The output of this CNN is a (coarse) estimate of the so called \"optical flow fleld\", but in contrast to most conventional schemes, the output is not (only) a 2D motion vector, but comes in terms of a vector of latent variables that describe the local motion in a richer, more informative way. This first layer will be tranined essentially like an auto-encoder network. During the training process, it will be investigated whether is is useful to include the measurements from the IMU into the loss function. This first \u00a0layer with a coarse subsampling of the \"extended optical flow\" field is subsequently fed into a second network which,given the already trained first CNN layer is trained to provide, together with the inertial measurement unit, the final ego-motion data, that is: the translational and rotational motion of the camera. This project is well suited for a student (or two students) who do not only have some initial knowledge about visual computing (e.g. from\u00a0TDT4195 - Visual Computing Fundamentals) and deep learning (e.g.\u00a0TDT4265 Computer Vision and Deep Learning) --- such knowledge is essential ---, but are also interested in thorough mathematical analysis and modeling of the regarded problem, and are interested in a _structured_ solution architecture that reflects all the known facts about the problem. So the ability and the willingness to regard the problem also from the mathematical and statistical side is a requirement. In the ideal case, the student(s) will be supported to report about their results not only in a thesis, but also in a conference paper. This is an option, but not a stringent requirement.

Each student (or couple of students) will study a sub theme of the theme SE and children, study the literature, plan an empirical investigation to collect data from processes that involve software engineers and software companies. Context: The rapid diffusion of digital information technologies has created an explosive growth in the amount of digital data. Data is a key asset to compete in today\u2019s business. Digitalization is concerned with using software and data to offer significantly improved products, pure software products as well as digital and data driven services. The intent is to create new revenue opportunities as well as replace traditional business models with new business models. Driving the digital transformation is especially challenging as it brings with it the rapid sequence of three technologies that build on each other, i.e. software, data and artificial intelligence (AI). Although traditionally the focus has been on software, increasingly the latter topics are becoming more important. It is data that allow us to generate insights that are far from obvious to the human mind and to detect patterns in large amounts of data that are elusive otherwise. AI and specially machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), provide technology to identify these patterns in data and then act on these patterns to deliver solutions that were unfeasible before or that function much better with the use of AI. To be able to handle the challenges of AI engineering, the software development needs to change. The organizations will need to change their business models, as well as business strategy, the architecture of products, systems and services, ways of working, processes and tools as well as organizational structure of the company.

Software engineering as a critical core capability where best practices are changing rapidly. Because the work practice around building and integrating machine learning into software and services is still emerging and is not uniform across all product teams, there is no systematic way to identify the key stakeholders on the topic of adoption. The way organizations structure the teams to work with AI Engineering is a challenge, first because it is not a \u201ctraditional\u201d way of developing software and second, there is a shortage of data analytics in the market, and it is not clear yet what is the demand of workload that will be needed for each software team. There is also little knowledge on  how to effectively have the different roles working together, we have to find ways that the data analysts works together with the software development teams and vice versa. To gain value from data analytics inside software development teams requires a strong data science skillset and there simply aren\u2019t that many people around that have this skillset. Training existing staff to become proficient in data science skills is quite challenging and most certainly harder than providing machine learning education to engineers and developers. Many in the industry believe that artificial intelligence applications, and especially machine and deep-learning models, suffer from the same challenges.

Context:. Society is progressively moving towards a socio-technical ecosystem in which the physical and virtual dimensions of life are more and more intertwined and where people interaction, more often than not, takes place with or is mediated by machines. \u201cA smart society is a set of systems that express a consensually established set of values. Everything flows from those values. It is one in which leaders and citizens make data-based decisions which enable constantly improving outcomes in economic prosperity, social well-being, environmental sustainability and good governance. A smart society includes a reward or incentive system that engenders socially desirable and environmentally regenerative behaviours without compulsion or punishment.\u201d  To be able to handle the challenges of Smart Society engineering, the software development needs to change.

Context: . Massive and ever growing amount of software is available today to children of younger and younger age through sites such as Facebook and Instagram, apps, and games. Children are increasingly using software intensive technologies. In some cases, the software is specifically made for solving a problem, like helping children with reading difficulties to learn how to read [5] or children with obesity to exercise [3]. In other cases, the software is made to enhance children creativity [8], like Scratch [10]. In most cases, software is made for commercial purposes and for entertaining children, like Callof Duty.. It is getting difficult every day to keep up with threats and vulnerabilities associated with these tools, apps or websites, especially for children. In the recent years we have assisted to a series of problems generated by the use of software by children. These problems arise from the use of both general software like Facebook and Instagram and specific software for children. Children can fall victim to cyber security threats like social engineering, cyber bullying, hacking, viruses, and damaging malware, cyber stalking, etc. through search engines, online advertisements and social networking websites such as Facebook, Twitter and lots of other websites [4]. Mental health issues and even suicide are been caused by interaction with software. Instagram removed nearly 10,000 images related to suicide and self harm every day in the months following the Molly Russell scandal(according to https://www.telegraph.co.uk). Physical health issues, like obesity [12] and diabetes are been caused by use of videogames.. Given the greater exposure of children to these technologies, the design research community takes into account children\u2019s abilities, interests, and developmental needs [6] when designing interfaces of software for children. In previous studies we have addressed creativity software for children [9]; exergames [3]; and software for motivating adolescents with Intellectual Disabilities [7]. As far as our knowledge, a categorization of software for children which balance creativity, security, and the various dimensions of child well-being (physical, mental, and social) have not been proposed. An emphasis will be put on studying existing software for children and develop a set of enablers(or characteristics) for good software for children. Ethics, privacy, explanability, cybersecurity, and children well-being will have to be integral part of the processes, so that the children who use software systems will be offered new possibilities and made aware of threads.

Dernest f\u00f8lger en fase hvor de siste skal lokaliseres og bringes hjem.

SLS algorithms, which we study here, are competitive in solving computationally hard problems such as satisfiability (SAT), sparse signal recovery, scheduling, and most probable explanations in Bayesian networks (BNs).  Essentially, SLS algorithms are greedy optimizers that also make random moves in order to avoid getting trapped in local but non-global optima.\u00a0\u00a0Further, SLS algorithms are interesting in that they can studied formally, for example by means of Markov chains. The goal of this project and thesis is to study the theory and application of SLS.  The following research questions are examples - specifics depend on finding a topic of broad and common interest.\u00a0 First, there are opportunities to improve SLS, with an eye to specific applications. Can this done by combining different heuristics and adaptive methods,\u00a0 perhaps including concepts from bio-inspired AI including evolutionary algorithms? Second, the computational cost of ML can  currently be high, and the use of SLS for ML, for example for feature selection by means of wrapper methods, is no exception. Maybe Markov chain-based analysis and/or high-performance computing can be the basis for SLS methods that better handle massive and complex datasets while reducing computational cost dramatically? Third, the theory and formal methods communities have also studied parametric Markov chains, but interactions with the AI and ML communities have been limited.

We focus on a fundamental optimization problem in machine learning. Successfully solving this problem will improve a wide range of tasks, for example, cluster analysis, topic discovery, signal processing, recommendation. In the above machine learning tasks, the model is often parameterized by nonnegative matrices (or vectors). The learning, implemented by convectional additive gradient based optimization, is inefficient in finding the relative scales among the matrix entries. It has been shown that multiplicative updates are an effective way to overcome the drawback. However, multiplicative updates currently are in batch mode. That is, the whole data set is used in each update, which can cause slow convergence and are prone to poor stationary points. In this project we propose to improve the optimization by combining multiplicative updates and stochastic gradient descent, where the resulting method is called stochastic multiplicative updates.

They usually require large sets of labeled training data. In this project, we address the problem of detecting objects in images / video by building up or learning _structured_ object models, that is: a composition of parts that make up the particular class of objects. Most objects of interests (human beings, animals, cars, buildings, ...) can be described as being built up by such parts. The research question to be addressed is whether from first training a conventional deep learning-based object detector, and subsequently analyzing the found and parameterized network, these parts can be found automatically, or possibly semi-automatically. If such a parts structure has been found, the approach to be followed is to itentify part detectors speciallized on these parts, and build up a structured 'decision system' that processes the results of the part detectors, the geometrical locations of the detected parts, the confidence level of the individual detections, and the relations between these parts. The hypothesis to be followed by this approach is that a statisitically optimum object detector can be built from combining the expressive power of deep neetworks in the part detectors, and the solid mathematical basis of making decisions based on the fusion of different object cues (location, geometrical relation, individual detection confidence). This architecture is supposed to have also the advantage of being 'explainable by construction', a requirement very often found these days for any serious application of machine learning in safety-critical environments.

In my world there is a difference between the concepts of learning and training. Learning is the concept of the brain. The brain changes it structure and functionality to adapt to the environment (may say learn to handle a task/problem). The underlying processes of learning are mostly unknown. Even if the processes of learning are unknown, there are some concepts at a higher abstraction level that are known, e.g. local communication, local information, local control vast parallelist and emergence. The concept of Artificial Neural Networks is training. Training uses some form of global control. Training has global information available. Training is (mostly) sequential. ANN is currently very successful solving problems that are hard to solve using traditional programming methods. One of the costs of the success is power. A supercomputer (like the one at NTNU) uses MW of power. Training is a time-consuming process, as such, training cost energy, time * power, training for a day cost can be 24 hours * 1 MW = 24 MWh. One observable property of the brain is power, the brain uses approx. 40W. ANNs uses mostly floating-point data, e.g. 64 bit. The brain uses pulses and analogue values. In resent research it has been shown that when trained an ANN's accuracy can be reduced, e.g. from 64 bit float down to far less precision, even down to binary (Binarized Neural Network). Such an reduction can make a system extremely much more energy efficient. However, such an reduction is done from a trained network. The training was executed at a high precision level. Binarized Neural Network In this project the goal is to get insight in the relationship between high precision and low precision networks by exploring the search landscape of high accuracy network versus low accuracy(binary) network.

Among others, two of the most important related to that are: 1) how to calibrate a low-cost sensor to provide measurements as good as possible when compared to a reference; 2) how to use low-cost sensors to compute air quality predictions. Calibrations can be based on physical models or data-driven. Whatever the option it must be assessed against a reference sensor, typically a more expensive, industrial sensor.

Nevertheless, there are still fundamentally problematic issues with these systems, that invite theoretical work on extensions of deep learning towards (traditional) probabilistic reasoning. This is a  topic of some interest, which has lead to nice tools that can be used for implementation/evaluation, like Tensorflow Probability and Pyro (built on top of PyTorch). For typical research trends, see Part III of \"The Deep Learning Book\" by Goodfellow et al. The selection of interesting research question(s) in this area will depend on the students' interest.

Language evolution is a highly multi-disciplinary research field with the main theories involving biological evolution, language learning, and cultural evolution. When trying to understand the origins of languages, we can try to compensate for the lack of empirical evidence by utilising evolutionary computational methods to create simulations of how language may have evolved over time, e.g., by creating \"language games\" to simulate communication between agents in a social setting. In general, simulations on language evolution tend to have relatively small and fixed population sizes, something this study could aim to change.

If a sufficient number of such points are tracked between two images, the relative pose (=translation and rotation) of the camera can be estimated. As any measurement in images is afflicted by errors, both these pose estimates as well as the estimated 3D positions of the observed image points are uncertain, and the estimation of the complete camera trajectory as well as the scene model \u201cstitched together\u201d from many views needs to be input data to a huge optimization problem.\nIn AROS, we have access to both real video footage from underwater missions, as well as a realistic simulation environment which is able to generate video sequences where the motion and the 3D geometry are precisely known (\u2018ground truth\u2019). The student project is integrated into our design and development process for a vSLAM system which is specifically tuned to be able with the substantial problems of underwater video material: limited visibility due to turbid water, bad illumination which is also moving with the robot vehicle, disturbances by plankton, dirt, and small fish, and many more.  Which part of the vSLAM development is determined to be the focus area of the student project is subject to negotiation; the intention is to let the students experiment with novel approaches proposed in the recent literature, some of them focusing on geometric models and statistical estimation theory, others on machine learning. So we are able to adapt the topic largely to the background knowledge the student(s) already have, and their interest into different relevant research fields, such as e.g. state estimation, optimization, object detection and tracking, machine learning and deep learning. Potential focus topics:.  * Robust keypoint tracking in the presence of underwater image degradation. * Dynamic Model based prediction and correcting in keypoint and object tracking in underwater conditions. * Pose graph and state sequence optimization for underwater visual SLAM. * Integration of IMU measurements in underwater visual SLAM. * Machine Learning for depth estimation, flow field estimation, and visual clutter detection  Potential focus topics:      Literature:  Literature D.

Most of the 3D FER state-of-the-art methods extract hand-crafted features [1-5], which could be considered as a digital signature of the face, and use them in order to compare different 3D faces through trained classifiers or similarity functions [6]. . The rise of deep learning networks tends to replace the hand-crafted features with features automatically extracted by the deep networks. Nonetheless, deep networks require large training datasets in order to converge and produce reliable results.. Up until recently, deep networks could not be sufficiently implemented in the case of 3D FER for two reasons: 1) lack of existence of large labelled 3D face datasets for training and 2) deep networks could not consume 3D data (3D meshes, point clouds etc.) as input.. The 1st issue has been solved with the improvement of the 3D data acquisition hardware. More and more 3D face datasets are produced [7-9], along with software capable of producing synthetic 3D face models [10], which can further augment the real data within a deep training process.. For resolving the 2nd issue, initially, the methodologies converted the actual 3D data into a 2D modality like depth images or geometry images [11, 12]. Thus making the data compatible with the existing deep networks. This is expected to change in the near future, due to the newest machine learning trend, the so-called Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) [13,14]. GDL introduces deep networks that can be fed with 3D meshes, point clouds and graphs. Thus, GDL models are very interesting to be studied in order to find out whether they can achieve a performance boost in terms of 3D FER evaluation measures, as they have already done in other computer vision applications.. Additionally, and depending on the progress, more applications of the system will be examined i.e. 3D Facial Expressions Recognition or 3D Facial Micro-expressions Detection.      ======================.

When building object detectors for marine applications, it is particularly important to have training sets which do not only contain a sufficient number of relevant object classes (ships, piers, buoys, ...), but also show the different variations in lighting conditions, and weather conditions (fog, rain, snow, ...). As it is difficult, if practically possible at all, to record a sufficient number of such images or videos for training object detector networks, this project aims at artificially generating these variations of image conditions, in particular different illumination and strongly different weather conditions.\nImage augmentation is a well-known technique for synthetically expanding limited or imbalanced training datasets used in computer vision tasks to improve generalization performance and to avoid overfitting. Likewise, augmentations can be used for testing network generalization performance, by imposing varying augmentations, e.g. two-dimensional augmentations such as shifts, rotations, etc., as well as natural phenomena, e.g. snow, fog, lighting conditions, etc., or even adding synthetic objects to the scene. The former is straightforward using simple transformations in two dimensions, whereas the latter should imitate realistic, and highly stochastic, scenarios that in reality depends on the depth information of the scene. Nonetheless, this is often done by basic image manipulations imposed uniformly over the whole scene without considering depth information and may result in unrealistic augmentations not representing reality and could possibly produce erroneous testing performance. As an example, fog or rain may be observed only at a certain distance and/or area and affects only specific far-away objects, rather than all objects in the scene. The proposed research topic is therefore to investigate techniques for extracting depth information from images or video and taking advantage of this information to apply augmentations of natural phenomena in 3-Dimensions.\nFor the extraction of this 3D information, one can use recent methods of single image depth estimation by deep neural networks, or \"motion stereo\" from a moving camera (in case of video sequences). Both approaches can also be combined.\nTherefore, the first partial goal of this project is to explore methods for depth estimation for given training images or videos.\nThe second goal is to use the extracted estimate of the depth structure to simulate the desired weather and illumination situation, such as fog, rain, or snow. Again, this can be done by \"classical\" physics-based computer graphics modeling, and/or by suitably trained deeep neural networks.\nAnother important aspect is to benchmark 2D and 3D synthetic augmentations against images containing actual natural phenomena\u2019s, i.e. network performance on synthetic scenes against true scenes.\nThis project will be performed with the Norwegian company DNV GL which is interested in quality assurance of marine detection systems, and will also be related to the marine multi-sensro simulator project currently pursued at NTNU.\nStudents who are interested in this project are advised to address Prof. Rudolf Mester at IDI for more details.

By the term 3D-to-2D Face Recognition (3D-2D FR) we refer to the procedure of face recognition using as input a typical 2D facial image query (or a sequence of 2D facial images of the same identity) against a dataset containing 3D facial models (i.e., facial meshes or point clouds).\u00a0. To the best of our knowledge, most of the 3D-2D FR state-of-the-art methods do not use deep learning procedures [1,2]. Thus, as a proposed approach, classical deep learning networks [3], able to extract meaningful features from sequences of 2D face images, as well as modern geometric deep networks [4], able to extract meaningful features from 3D facial models, could be combined, using appropriate loss functions [6], in the form of the so-called Siamese Networks [5].. The training of such a network could be performed by using synthetic data to be generated by the FaceGen [7] tool that is available at the Visual Computing Lab.   ======================.

The focus of the thesis is to use artificial intelligence (AI) and multimodal data (MMD) to understand and support children\u2019s learning experiences through a carefully designed dashboard and data driven feedback mechanisms. MMD is derived from eyetracker, wrist band, and motion sensor (i.e., skeletal tracking). The dashboard provides the educational facilitator (i.e., instructor or parent) with a real-time visualisation of the learners cognitive, affective and physiological state based on the collected MMD. AI components will produce feedback mechanisms, which may be delivered directly to the learner, or to their educational facilitator.  Thesis Description. In a first step, the student needs to review the literature and familiarize themself with multimodal dashboard system. Then, the candidate will conceptualise and implement AI components to drive feedback mechanisms which support the learner during learning activities (directly or via their educational facilitator).

On the other hand the heart\u2019s anatomy is very well depicted using ultrasound images (e.g. 3D transesophageal ultrasound - TEE), however these images have a much smaller field of view due to the positioning of the TEE probe with regards to the heart. Therefore, tools that can automatically identify the position and orientation of the ultrasound probe and cathethers in X-ray images as well as automatic localization of anatomic structures of interest is highly desirable. Today most of these tasks are solved manually or semi-automatically, however automating them would improve the accuracy and also reduce the amount of time the interventionalists spend on aligning the images. We propose three topics for master theses all related to interventional applications of ultrasound imaging. They are:. - AI for ultrasound probe detection in X-ray images, the task will be to identify the location of the ultrasound probe but also its pose  - AI for catheter detection in the ultrasound volume and highlight of it in the image. The goal is to automatically detect catheter, delivery device and artificial devices (like MitraClip or artificial valves). Those objects give somewhat different echo signals but not always very clear nor complete. The task will be to detect automatically such objects within 3D ultrasound datasets. - AI for aortic valve detection in mitral trans esophageal acquisitions of the heart. Previous work supervised by Gabriel Kiss have been focusing on automatically detecting the mitral valve in 3D ultrasound data. This project aims at also detecting the aortic valve. The ultimate goal is automatic detection of anatomical structures running very fast (real-time if possible), so that the 3D data could automatic be presented in a way that makes sense to the physician, by rotating, cropping the 3D data based on the information detected in the images.

The ownership of data/information has always been a concern but with GDPR there will be more awareness as well as more obligations related to data collection and sharing. Today data-monopolies like Facebook, Google, Amazon (FGA)  etc. are relying most of their business on the data they collect about people, and this without paying for this data. In the near future, people will conceive  information/data as \u201ccommodity\u201d, i.e., something that can be sold and bought. For example, with the enforcement of GDPR all people will be able to get the data that companies such as FGA collect about them and then sell it to smaller companies that may use this data for generating new business models. The topic of this thesis is to develop further the blockchain-based data marketplace that enables data selling and buying while resolving trust and privacy problems. The Data Marketplace uses Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts to allow peers to communicate about the conditions of data sharing and perform the data exchange itself.

Important: the project could also be redefined, in agreement between the supervisor and the student(s) to put most emphasis on the software side of the mobile robot, behaviour, and 'intelligence'.

Supervised learning requires data instances annotated with the correct output labels, but the other paradigms assume no such labelled data. Reinforcement learning is primarily concerned with what actions an intelligent agent (or group of agents) should take in a specified environment in order to maximise some cumulative reward, while simultaneously exploring the environment and exploiting previously accumulated knowledge. The environment is commonly formulated as a Markov decision process or as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), depending on whether the agent can observe the current environmental state directly or whether the observed states are distorted by noise. Reinforcement learning agents have shown strong performance on classical games, making this an interesting approach to test in general in the context of computational creativity. However, a creative \u201cgame\u201d type setting using the standard Monte Carlo algorithm can be a time-consuming process. An alternative can then be to utilise strategies that combine ideas from neural network type set-ups with evolutionary approaches (e.g., compositional pattern-producing networks; Stanley 2007) or model-free reinforcement learning such as Q-learning (or deep Q-learning as introduced by Google DeepMind; Mnih et al. 2015, Silver et al. 2018), which only learns the value of an action in a particular state (stochastic transitions and rewards), without having a model of the environment. Within \u201ccreative\u201d applications these types of strategies can form part of a generative adversarial network (GAN; Goodfellow et al. 2014), which so far mainly has been explored in image generation (Huang et al. 2019, Mellor et al. 2019, Ekern & Gamb\u00e4ck 2021).

Most of the state-of-the-art methods extract hand-crafted features [1, 2], which could be considered as a digital signature of the face and use them in order to compare different faces through trained classifiers or similarity functions. The rise of deep learning networks [3] tends to replace the hand-crafted features with features automatically extracted by the deep network. . Based on the above, the purpose of this Thesis is to provide continuous face authentication over webcam data against certified 2D facial data. Existing 2D face tracking, 2D authentication methods should be implemented. Different 2D face authentication networks for webcam images should be compared in terms of accuracy and terms of use.

Once the plastic reaches the oceans, it is broken down into smaller particles(micro-plastic) by being exposed to ultra violet (UV) radiation and mechanical abrasion from wave actions [1].The quantity of plastic waste floating at the ocean surface in 2013 was estimated to be approximately 269,000 tonnes (small macro- to micro-plastic), this estimate does not include plastic in-depth or at the seafloor). The plastic debris can affect the wildlife in multiple ways, such as entanglement- entrapping, encircling, or constricting,ingestion- accidental ingestion or ingestion of prey containing plastic, and interaction- being in contact with plastic debris [1].It is therefore important to be able to detect and collect the plastic waste in nature,before it reaches the oceans. Once plastic waste has reaches a micro-stadium, it is near impossible to collect it and remove it from the water. An analysis on deep sea locations(range from 1176 to 4843m) showed that there was an average abundance of 1 micro-plastic per 25cm3(particle sizes ranging from 75 to 161\u03bcm) [2] The AI-task will support the observation and monitoring of plastic items\u200b at consumer side, such as cities, beaches..... We will monitor the geographic distribution of different types of plastic items in these areas. The data will be gathered by citizens in form of taking photos of plastic objects. The photos will be taken using an application on smart phones. The application will have an artificial intelligence (deep learning) algorithm specially tailored for recognition of the material type of the plastic in the photos. The combined information about the geographic distribution, plastic type, and the object type (e.g., bottle, bag) pertinent to plastic debris will be collected in a database which in turn will be statistically analyzed and visualized. The smart application will serve as a tool for empowering citizen science and will contribute to the increase of the awareness and collaboration of citizens towards mitigation of plastic pollution problem.

Slike oppgaver er typisk utformet p\u00e5 den m\u00e5ten at alle kodeliner som trengs for l\u00f8sningen, er gitt - men i omstokket rekkef\u00f8lge - slik at de m\u00e5 trekkes til riktig posisjon for \u00e5 f\u00e5 til en l\u00f8sning. Hvis \u00f8kt vanskegrad er \u00f8nskelig, kan oppgavene ogs\u00e5 inneholde distraktorer, dvs. kodelinjer som ikke skal brukes i l\u00f8sningen. For eksempel p\u00e5 Parsons problems, se f.eks.\u00a0https://www.codio.com/blog/parsons-problems Normalt har slike dra-og-slipp-oppgaver v\u00e6rt ment for \u00e5 l\u00f8ses individuelt. Ideen i dette prosjektet er \u00e5 se p\u00e5 mulige designl\u00f8sninger for \u00e5 f\u00e5 dra-og-slipp-oppgaver til \u00e5 fungere som en gruppeaktivitet, for l\u00e6ring, moro, eller kanskje ogs\u00e5 som et spill med et konkurranseaspekt. Dette vil inneb\u00e6re \u00e5 utvikle en l\u00f8sning hvor flere studenter over nettet kan samarbeide om l\u00f8sningen av slike problemer, f.eks. at 3-4 studenter skal l\u00f8se en slik oppgave sammen. Her kan det tenkes flere ulike varianter, f.eks. med og uten distraktorer som nevnt over. Et annet aspekt som kan variere, er hva studentene f\u00e5r utdelt av informasjon eller puslespillbiter. \"Alle f\u00e5r alt\" \u00a0vil v\u00e6re ett yttterpunkt, her vil alle studentene ha tilgang til alle kodelinjene som er utdelt. Dette har antageligvis noen klare fordeler med at hver deltager har mulighet til \u00e5 f\u00e5 oversikt over hele l\u00f8sningsrommet. Samtidig har det ogs\u00e5 potensielle ulemper. I programmering for nybegynnere kommer studentene inn med h\u00f8yst ulike forutsetninger. Noen har allerede hatt programmering som hobby i \u00e5revis eller har tatt valgfag i lavere utdanning. Andre er helt ferske. \"Alle f\u00e5r alt\" vil inneb\u00e6re at den flinkeste av studentene i en gruppe p\u00e5 3-4, raskt vil kunne skj\u00f8nne hele l\u00f8sningen, uten at de andre blir s\u00e6rlig involvert. Hvis studentene derimot f\u00e5r utdelt ulike puslespillbiter, og hver bare ser de man selv har f\u00e5tt utdelt, er ogs\u00e5 de svakere studentene n\u00f8dt til \u00e5 putte kodelinjer inn p\u00e5 riktig plass i l\u00f8sningsomr\u00e5det for at gruppen skal lykkes - og blir dermed mer aktivt involvert. Dette kan ogs\u00e5 n\u00f8dvendiggj\u00f8re mer kommunikasjon mellom gruppemedlemmene for \u00e5 l\u00f8se oppgaven (\"Hvilke kodelinjer har du?\"; \"Er det noen som har en if-setning?\"), slik at det kanskje ogs\u00e5 kan bli \u00f8velse i kommunikasjon og samarbeid, ikke bare en \u00f8velse i programmering. For eventuell spillifisering kunne man tenke seg at mange grupper a 3-4 studenter konkurrerer med hverandre om \u00e5 l\u00f8se samme oppgave, eksempel med poengscore basert p\u00e5 hvor kjapt man l\u00f8ser oppgaven, men med trekk for eventuelle feilfors\u00f8k slik at det ikke skal l\u00f8nne seg \u00e5 bare kjapt pr\u00f8ve og feile med ulike omstokkinger av koden.

Both already implemented and new, emerging solutions will be explored. In the first case, the description of these tools will include contextual factors for their implementation and potential indicators of effectiveness. The knowledge generated will thus allow for the identification of enablers or barriers for the use of the associated tools.

Kahoot! wants to enrich the content on the platform to build a better foundation for functionality like recommendations that will help improve end users\u2019 experience. Detailed project description. The overall goal of this problem is for Kahoot! to learn more about the content being created on its platform, and use this learning to create a better experience for its users. The majority of user-generated content on the Kahoot!. platform consists of true information being used to teach, engage and learn. By enriching this content, Kahoot! may support its users in several ways, for instance: Detailed project description   Wrong answer suggestions: multiple choices require crafting wrong answers. For instance, with questions like \u201cWhat\u2019s the capital of Norway?\u201d, wrong answers which aren\u2019t too obvious can be Bergen, Trondheim, Stockholm. Bad answers can be apple, sea, dog. By giving suggestions to the users on good answer alternatives, the users can concentrate more on the actual content.. \u00a0Learning made more complete: with users creating kahoots on all sorts of topics, some kahoots may be missing crucial questions for the learners to understand the whole picture of a topic.

Giving the content creator suggestions on questions or topic areas related to the created quiz can make the learning process more complete for the audience. Unlike the classic Kahoot! live game, Kahoot! challenges are self-paced and are not limited by the users\u2019 location or time. Questions and answers are displayed on the learners\u2019 device and they can complete the challenge at their own pace. When users have finished a challenge, new challenges for the users to take can be recommended, for instance: Topic completion: For instance, a user may have a lot of interest in geography. By analyzing kahoots created in the field of geography, other kahoots needed for the user to become a geography expert can be suggested.. Logical next step: Similarly, we could identify common learning paths and help suggest logical next steps. Topic completion: For instance, a user may have a lot of interest in geography. By analyzing kahoots created in the field of geography, other kahoots needed for the user to become a geography expert can be suggested. Logical next step: Similarly, we could identify common learning paths and help suggest logical next steps. To achieve all of these suggestions, Kahoot! needs a way of extracting information from all kahoots created and combining information with other sources of information using a structured knowledge base, for example Wikipedia. All information may then be stored in a hierarchical knowledge graph to be used by future algorithms or analyses. Named-entity recognition algorithms may subsequently be used to analyze the content. Combining this analysis and the knowledge graph, sophisticated and valuable suggestions and future functionality may be made for the users.

Context:. Society is progressively moving towards a socio-technical ecosystem in which the physical and virtual dimensions of life are more and more intertwined and where people interaction, more often than not, takes place with or is mediated by machines. \u201cA smart society is a set of systems that express a consensually established set of values. Everything flows from those values. It is one in which leaders and citizens make data-based decisions which enable constantly improving outcomes in economic prosperity, social well-being, environmental sustainability and good governance. A smart society includes a reward or incentive system that engenders socially desirable and environmentally regenerative behaviours without compulsion or punishment.\u201d  To be able to handle the challenges of Smart Society engineering, the software development needs to change. The organizations will need to change their business models, as well as business strategy, the architecture of products, systems and services, ways of working, processes and tools as well as organizational structure of the company. The demand for innovation now, calls for a revolutionary mindset that combines skillsets that are not traditionally found in software teams. Software engineering as a critical core capability where best practices are changing rapidly. These developments challenge current software engineering practice due the increasing role of software in massive developing Collective Adaptive System applications. This call is for novel methods and tools for designing, implementing and managing intelligent software, systems and services. Special attention is required to empirical validation of these methods and tools in realistic use in order to guarantee the impact of research contributions.

B\u00f8ndene slipper sauene ut p\u00e5 fritt beite rundt midten av mai og sanker de inn igjen fra september og til sn\u00f8en legger seg. I denne tiden g\u00e5r sauen fritt i skog og fjell med tilsyn i prinsippet en gang i uka. Sanking av sauene om h\u00f8sten er en flertrinnsoperasjon som normalt tar et antall uker. Man g\u00e5r oftest gjennom et par runder per hovedbeiteomr\u00e5de hvor de aller fleste sauene lokaliseres og drives hjem til g\u00e5rden. Dernest f\u00f8lger en fase hvor de siste skal lokaliseres og bringes hjem. Denne siste fasen er oftest langvarig og arbeidskrevende da man ofte ikke har noen god formening om hvor sauene befinner seg. Systemet vi skal utvikle har prim\u00e6rt til hensikt \u00e5 effektivisere lokaliseringen av disse siste sauene slik at sauebonden kan spare det meste av det sv\u00e6rt tidkrevende s\u00f8kearbeidet.

Radioen skal v\u00e6re s\u00e5 liten at den kan inkluderes i sauens \u00f8remerke uten at dette \u00f8kes i areal. Radioen skal ha en rekkevidde p\u00e5 opptil 300 til 500 meter. Radioen skal sende ut et \u00abping\u00bb med jevne mellomrom som kan fanges opp av en drone. . Man benytter en flydrone til \u00e5 s\u00f8ke etter sauene over et stort areal. N\u00e5r flydronen mottar et signal fra en eller flere sauer, registrerer den sin egen GPS-posisjon. Vi vet da et sauen befinner seg innenfor en radius av 300 til 500 meter i forhold til dronens posisjon. Det vil ogs\u00e5 v\u00e6re mulig \u00e5 m\u00e5le avstanden til sauen ved \u00e5 g\u00e5 over i s\u00e5kalt \u00abranging-modus\u00bb s\u00e5 snart en har mottatt signal fra sauen. Denne informasjonen lastes ned til en sentral hvor en bonde p\u00e5 et kart vil se dronens rute og hvor den har registrert sau.    Radioteknologi. Radiodelen av systemet skal baseres p\u00e5 Long Range Bluetooth chip nRF52833 fra Nordic Semiconductor. Ved hjelp av utviklingskit skal en lage en demonstrator for systemet.

Children are increasingly using software intensive technologies. In some cases, the software is specifically made for solving a problem, like helping children with reading difficulties to learn how to read [5] or children with obesity to exercise [3]. In other cases, the software is made to enhance children creativity [8], like Scratch [10]. In most cases, software is made for commercial purposes and for entertaining children, like Callof Duty.. It is getting difficult every day to keep up with threats and vulnerabilities associated with these tools, apps or websites, especially for children. In the recent years we have assisted to a series of problems generated by the use of software by children. These problems arise from the use of both general software like Facebook and Instagram and specific software for children. Children can fall victim to cyber security threats like social engineering, cyber bullying, hacking, viruses, and damaging malware, cyber stalking, etc. through search engines, online advertisements and social networking websites such as Facebook, Twitter and lots of other websites [4]. Mental health issues and even suicide are been caused by interaction with software. Instagram removed nearly 10,000 images related to suicide and self harm every day in the months following the Molly Russell scandal(according to https://www.telegraph.co.uk). Physical health issues, like obesity [12] and diabetes are been caused by use of videogames.. Given the greater exposure of children to these technologies, the design research community takes into account children\u2019s abilities, interests, and developmental needs [6] when designing interfaces of software for children. In previous studies we have addressed creativity software for children [9]; exergames [3]; and software for motivating adolescents with Intellectual Disabilities [7]. As far as our knowledge, a categorization of software for children which balance creativity, security, and the various dimensions of child well-being (physical, mental, and social) have not been proposed. An emphasis will be put on studying existing software for children and develop a set of enablers(or characteristics) for good software for children. Ethics, privacy, explanability, cybersecurity, and children well-being will have to be integral part of the processes, so that the children who use software systems will be offered new possibilities and made aware of threads.    The student(s) will:. Run a systematic literature review and prepare a paper for journal. Plan an empirical investigation. Run an empirical investigation (data collection, data analysis) with children and/or software engineers as subjects. Propose Software Engineering Process with children as stakeholders . Paper Writing for Conference, like ICSE Society Track      The supervisor will provide the student(s) with Initial Literature and help the student(s) to access to Stakeholders and initial data for the Empirical Investigation. If the project will be run as a 15 + 30 project, I expect that during the Autumn semester the student(s) will implement steps 1 and 2 and during Spring Semester steps 3,4,5.. The supervisor wish to interact with the master students and organize workshops and supervision sessions weekly.   References. [1] S. Easterbrook, J. Singer, M.-A. Storey, and D. Damian.

Language evolution is a highly multi-disciplinary research field with the main theories involving biological evolution, language learning, and cultural evolution. When trying to understand the origins of languages, we can try to compensate for the lack of empirical evidence by utilising evolutionary computational methods to create simulations of how language may have evolved over time, e.g., by creating \"language games\" to simulate communication between agents in a social setting. In general, simulations on language evolution tend to have relatively small and fixed population sizes, something this study could aim to change.

The ownership of data/information has always been a concern but with GDPR there will be more awareness as well as more obligations related to data collection and sharing. Today data-monopolies like Facebook, Google, Amazon (FGA)  etc. are relying most of their business on the data they collect about people, and this without paying for this data. In the near future, people will conceive  information/data as \u201ccommodity\u201d, i.e., something that can be sold and bought. For example, with the enforcement of GDPR all people will be able to get the data that companies such as FGA collect about them and then sell it to smaller companies that may use this data for generating new business models. The topic of this thesis is to develop further the blockchain-based data marketplace that enables data selling and buying while resolving trust and privacy problems. The Data Marketplace uses Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts to allow peers to communicate about the conditions of data sharing and perform the data exchange itself. For example, this platform will make me able to sell my facebook data to a company and provide service to me for  bargaining about the price as well as  including my privacy preferences and constraints into the deal.

However, studies have shown incorporating clinical text can improve sepsis detection [1,2].  To better utilize clinical text for understanding underlying sepsis signs and symptoms, a small annotated corpus and knowledge model for sepsis is currently being developed using adverse event reports.  These adverse event reports contain notes which document incidents that have caused harm to a patient at the hospital. The main objective of this project is to classify different types of infections related to catheters using adverse event notes and the knowledge model [3]. Because adverse event reports contain many different events, there are possibilities to focus on other aspects such as but not limited:. 1. Use machine learning methods to classify other events not related to catheters and infection events in adverse event notes [4].. 2. Create an ontology for knowledge representation of infection and catheter [5].. 3. Create a Norwegian clinical BERT embedding using adverse event notes [6].. 4. Use active learning to select specific relevant notes to annotate [7].. 5. Use deep learning for detecting events [8, 9].      This project is for 1 or 2 students.

Still, in high-income countries vast resources are spent dealing with the condition, with jaundice being the number one reason for readmissions to the hospital after birth [4].\n\nWeakly Supervised Approach for Detecting Important Pixels\nWe hypothesize that certain pixels or clusters of pixels of a skin image do not provide any predictive information and may confuse some types of estimation methods. For example, highlights or shadows are such types of pixel clusters that most likely do not contribute to an accurate estimation of bilirubin.\n\nRQ: How can we learn without any labeled data (ground truth masks) a model that would be able to identify pixels that contribute to an accurate bilirubin estimation?\n\nHere we have several promising and detailed hypotheses to test, but they may require a low level (mathematical) understanding of neural nets.\n\nThe potential contributions are at least threefold:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. Insights on which parts of the skin image carry the predictive information for bilirubin estimation, and whether this is dependent on the estimation method.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2. Automated feature selection improving bilirubin estimation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3. Partial explainability of estimations.\n\nPicterus\nPicterus [1] is a growing start-up bringing biophysics and machine learning to healthcare with the ambition to provide accurate and low-cost solutions for jaundice diagnosis. Picterus has developed a smartphone app as a novel approach for neonatal (newborn) jaundice diagnostic and monitoring [2]. Particularly, Picterus is using computer vision to estimate bilirubin levels, the chemical compound causing jaundice at high concentrations.\n\nDataset\nWe own a unique dataset of newborns\u2019 skin images coupled with bilirubin concentrations that Picterus has collected across multiple continents.\nRequirements\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2022 A friendly relation with programming and machine learning.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2022 Experience with Python and machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2022 Basic knowledge of calculus, linear algebra and statistics are beneficial.
